          <h1>A good visualization example</h1>

          <p>
            I like this visualization because government's budget has been a
            huge vast area that only interative and attractive visualization can
            help people understand it. And this map is exactly the visualization
            we are looking for. The color help we visually infer how government
            spends their budget against different categories, and also to
            compare between different categories - for example medicare vs
            social security. Moreover, the categories are grouped in different
            big groups (Health Care, National Defense, etc) - where each group
            have categories with similar color (ex: National Defense has color
            yellow, Income Security has color green) that helps us in comparing
            categories of the same group or categories in different groups.

          <h1>A bad visualization example</h1>
          <br />
          <img
            src="bad_visualization.png"
            alt="Subscriptions by Age"
            width="100%"
          />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            This is a bad visualization because the origin of the y-axis is not
            starting at 0, which make the visua lization misleading. In fact,
            the diiferent in subscription of the age 45-54 (lowest - 82%) is not
            that different from that of the age 18-24 (highest - 98%). However,
            the misleading visualization starting at 80% make us misunderstand
            that there is a huge gap between the lowest and the higest.
            Moreover, the visualization lacks the label of x_axis and y_axis to
            inform the information to viewer.

          <h3>The correct way to do it</h3>
          <p>
            I am hard-coding the data and run a script in visualization.py to
            produce a better visualization. Here is the result:
          </p>
          <img
            src="corrected_visualization.png"
            alt="Corrected Visualization of Subscriptions by Age"
            width="100%"
          />
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            My design make the start of y_axis to be 0 instead of 80. This make
            user identify that the difference between age groups are not that
            significant (so it is not as misleading as the old visualization).
            Also, I added labels for x_axis and y_axis for better view.
