        <h2>What do you want to achieve with the visualization?</h2>
        <p>
          As you can see, there are a lot of stories from the dataset, and
          reading all of them can be tiresome. So, my visualization aims to give
          user a summary of each story - to have an idea of what the story is
          talking about, without having to read the whole story. Thus, the text
          data would be easier to understand. Moreover, I want user to be able
          to compare between stories: for example, what are the common and
          different points between the stories. The hidden features within each
          story would be exposed to the user - so I am hoping for them to see
          something that cannot be seen through the plain text.
        </p>

        <h2>What tasks do you want to support?</h2>
        <p>I want to support the following task:</p>
        <p>
          Word frequency visualization: create visualizations that help user
          identify the frequency of the word. User should be able to see what
          words are frequently appear in each story.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also want to be able to compare between stories to see the
          similarity between them. For example, user would be able to select a
          story and see the 10 most common stories visualized with score and
          graph.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <h2>What designs will help you accomplish these? Name at least two</h2>
        <p>
          For word frequency, I will use Word Clouds / Wordle to draw word
          chart. The bigger the word, the higher frequency it is
        </p>
        <p>
          For stories comparision, I will calculate the cosine similarity score
          between them (consider each story as a vector and calculate similarity
          score between stories). Then, I get the most common stories with
          respect to a story and visualize it
