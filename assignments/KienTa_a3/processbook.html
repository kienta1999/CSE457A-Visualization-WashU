        <h2>What do you want to achieve with the visualization?</h2>
        <p>
          As you can see, there are a lot of stories from the dataset, and
          reading all of them can be tiresome. So, my visualization aims to give
          user an overview of each story - to have a general idea of what the
          story is talking about, without having to read the whole story. Thus,
          the text data would be easier to understand. Moreover, I want user to
          be able to compare between stories: for example, what are the common
          points between the stories. The similarity scores between stories in
          combination with word count would be exposed to the user - so I am
          hoping for them to see something that cannot be seen through the plain
          text.
        </p>

        <h2>What tasks do you want to support?</h2>
        <p>I want to support the following task:</p>
        <p>
          Word frequency visualization: create visualizations that help user
          identify the frequency of the word. User should be able to see what
          words are frequently appear in each story.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also want to be able to compare between stories to see the
          similarity between them. For example, user would be able to select a
          story and see the 10 most common stories visualized with score and
          graph.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <h2>What designs will help you accomplish these? Name at least two</h2>
        <p>
          For word frequency, I will use Word Clouds / Wordle and an 1D chart to
          visualize how often the word appears. The bigger the word (and the
          bigger the circle, the darker the color), the higher frequency it is
        </p>
        <p>
          For stories comparision, I will calculate the cosine similarity score
          between them (consider each story as a vector and calculate similarity
          score between stories). Then, I get the most common stories with
          respect to a story and visualize it
        </p>

        <h2>Sketches</h2>

        <h2>A justification for the final design</h2>
        <p>
          I choose wordle and the 1d chart to visualize text frequency because
          while Wordle helps user to see the words that appears frequently in an
          visually appealing way, the 1D map helps us actually see how often the
          word show up (I also implement a tooltip to see the actual value). The
          visualization will help user see the frequency of the word and thus
          grasp the general idea of the story
        </p>

        <p>
          I choose bar chart to visualize the top most similar stories to a
          specific story because the bar chart correctly refect the magnitude of
          the similarity score. By looking at the chart, user will be able to
          see which story is most similar to another, and also which story is
          different from another.
