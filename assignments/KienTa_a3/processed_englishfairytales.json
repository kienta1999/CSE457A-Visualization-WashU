her sing but what she      sang he couldnt hear so he stopped and saidwhat was that you were singing my good womanthe woman was ashamed to let him hear what her daughter had been doing so      she sang instead of thatstars o mine said the king i never heard tell of any one that could      do thatthen he said look you here i want a wife and ill marry your daughter      but look you here says he eleven months out of the year she shall have      all she likes to eat and all the gowns she likes to get and all the      company she likes to keep but the last month of the year shell have to      spin five skeins every day and if she dont i shall kill herall right says the woman for she thought what a grand marriage that      was and as for the five skeins when the time came thered be plenty of      ways of getting out of it and likeliest hed have forgotten all about      itwell so they were married and for eleven months the girl had all she      liked to eat and all the gowns she liked to get and all the company she      liked to keepbut when the time was getting over she began to think about the skeins      and to wonder if he had em in mind but not one word did he say about      em and she thought hed wholly forgotten emhowever the last day of the last month he takes her to a room shed never      set eyes on before there was nothing in it but a spinningwheel and a      stool and says he now my dear here youll be shut in tomorrow with      some victuals and some flax and if you havent spun five skeins by the      night your headll go offand away he went about his businesswell she was that frightened shed always been such a gatless girl that      she didnt so much as know how to spin and what was she to do tomorrow      with no one to come nigh her to help her she sat down on a stool in the      kitchen and law how she did cryhowever all of a sudden she heard a sort of a knocking low down on the      door she upped and oped it and what should she see but a small little      black thing with a long tail that looked up at her right curious and      that saidwhat are you acrying forwhats that to you says shenever you mind that said but tell me what youre

    "original_content": "once upon a time there was a farmer and his wife who had one daughter and      she was courted by a gentleman every evening he used to come and see her      and stop to supper at the farmhouse and the daughter used to be sent down      into the cellar to draw the beer for supper so one evening she had gone      down to draw the beer and she happened to look up at the ceiling while      she was drawing and she saw a mallet stuck in one of the beams it must      have been there a long long time but somehow or other she had never      noticed it before and she began athinking and she thought it was very      dangerous to have that mallet there for she said to herself suppose him      and me was to be married and we was to have a son and he was to grow up      to be a man and come down into the cellar to draw the beer like as im      doing now and the mallet was to fall on his head and kill him what a      dreadful thing it would be and she put down the candle and the jug and      sat herself down and began acryingwell they began to wonder upstairs how it was that she was so long      drawing the beer and her mother went down to see after her and she found      her sitting on the settle crying and the beer running over the floor      why whatever is the matter said her mother oh mother says she      look at that horrid mallet suppose we was to be married and was to have      a son and he was to grow up and was to come down to the cellar to draw      the beer and the mallet was to fall on his head and kill him what a      dreadful thing it would be dear dear what a dreadful thing it would      be said the mother and she sat her down aside of the daughter and      started acrying too then after a bit the father began to wonder that      they didnt come back and he went down into the cellar to look after them      himself and there they two sat acrying and the beer running all over      the floor whatever is the matter says he why says the mother      look at that horrid mallet just suppose if our daughter and her      sweetheart was to be married and was to have a son and he was to grow      up and was to come down into the cellar to draw the beer and the mallet      was to fall on his head and kill him what a dreadful thing it would be       dear dear dear so it would said the father and he sat himself down      aside of the other two and started acryingnow the gentleman got tired of stopping up in the kitchen by himself and      at last he went down into the cellar too to see what they were after and      there they three sat acrying side by side and the beer running all over      the floor and he ran straight and turned the tap then he said whatever      are you three doing sitting there crying and letting the beer run all      over the flooroh says the father look at that horrid mallet suppose you and our      daughter was to be married and was to have a son and he was to grow up      and was to come down into the cellar to draw the beer and the mallet was      to fall on his head and kill him and then they all started acrying      worse than before but the gentleman burst out alaughing and reached up      and pulled out the mallet and then he said ive travelled many miles      and i never met three such big sillies as you three before and now i      shall start out on my travels again and when i can find three bigger      sillies than you three then ill come back and marry your daughter so      he wished them goodbye and started off on his travels and left them all      crying because the girl had lost her sweetheartwell he set out and he travelled a long way and at last he came to a      womans cottage that had some grass growing on the roof and the woman was      trying to get her cow to go up a ladder to the grass and the poor thing      durst not go so the gentleman asked the woman what she was doing why      lookye she said look at all that beautiful grass im going to get the      cow on to the roof to eat it shell be quite safe for i shall tie a      string round her neck and pass it down the chimney and tie it to my      wrist as i go about the house so she cant fall off without my knowing      it oh you poor silly said the gentleman you should cut the grass      and throw it down to the cow but the woman thought it was easier to get      the cow up the ladder than to get the grass down so she pushed her and      coaxed her and got her up and tied a string round her neck and passed it      down the chimney and fastened it to her own wrist and the gentleman went      on his way but he hadnt gone far when the cow tumbled off the roof and      hung by the string tied round her neck and it strangled her and the      weight of the cow tied to her wrist pulled the woman up the chimney and      she stuck fast halfway and was smothered in the sootwell that was one big sillyand the gentleman went on and on and he went to an inn to stop the night      and they were so full at the inn that they had to put him in a      doublebedded room and another traveller was to sleep in the other bed      the other man was a very pleasant fellow and they got very friendly      together but in the morning when they were both getting up the      gentleman was surprised to see the other hang his trousers on the knobs of      the chest of drawers and run across the room and try to jump into them      and he tried over and over again and couldnt manage it and the      gentleman wondered whatever he was doing it for at last he stopped and      wiped his face with his handkerchief oh dear he says i do think      trousers are the most awkwardest kind of clothes that ever were i cant      think who could have invented such things it takes me the best part of an      hour to get into mine every morning and i get so hot how do you manage      yours so the gentleman burst out alaughing and showed him how to put      them on and he was very much obliged to him and said he never should      have thought of doing it that wayso that was another big sillythen the gentleman went on his travels again and he came to a village      and outside the village there was a pond and round the pond was a crowd      of people and they had got rakes and brooms and pitchforks reaching      into the pond and the gentleman asked what was the matter why they      say matter enough moons tumbled into the pond and we cant rake her      out anyhow so the gentleman burst out alaughing and told them to look      up into the sky and that it was only the shadow in the water but they      wouldnt listen to him and abused him shamefully and he got away as      quick as he couldso there was a whole lot of sillies bigger than them three sillies at      home so the gentleman turned back home again and married the farmers      daughter and if they didnt live happy for ever after thats nothing to      do with you or me",

    "original_content": "mr and mrs vinegar lived in a vinegar bottle now one day when mr      vinegar was from home mrs vinegar who was a very good housewife was      busily sweeping her house when an unlucky thump of the broom brought the      whole house clitterclatter clitterclatter about her ears in an agony      of grief she rushed forth to meet her husbandon seeing him she exclaimed oh mr vinegar mr vinegar we are ruined      i have knocked the house down and it is all to pieces mr vinegar then      said my dear let us see what can be done here is the door i will take      it on my back and we will go forth to seek our fortunethey walked all that day and at nightfall entered a thick forest they      were both very very tired and mr vinegar said my love i will climb      up into a tree drag up the door and you shall follow he accordingly      did so and they both stretched their weary limbs on the door and fell      fast asleepin the middle of the night mr vinegar was disturbed by the sound of      voices underneath and to his horror and dismay found that it was a band      of thieves met to divide their bootyhere jack said one heres five pounds for you here bill heres      ten pounds for you here bob heres three pounds for youmr vinegar could listen no longer his terror was so great that he      trembled and trembled and shook down the door on their heads away      scampered the thieves but mr vinegar dared not quit his retreat till      broad daylighthe then scrambled out of the tree and went to lift up the door what did      he see but a number of golden guineas come down mrs vinegar he      cried come down i say our fortunes made our fortunes made come      down i saymrs vinegar got down as fast as she could and when she saw the money she      jumped for joy now my dear said she ill tell you what you shall      do there is a fair at the neighbouring town you shall take these forty      guineas and buy a cow i can make butter and cheese which you shall sell      at market and we shall then be able to live very comfortablymr vinegar joyfully agrees takes the money and off he goes to the fair      when he arrived he walked up and down and at length saw a beautiful red      cow it was an excellent milker and perfect in every way oh thought      mr vinegar if i had but that cow i should be the happiest man aliveso he offers the forty guineas for the cow and the owner said that as he      was a friend hed oblige him so the bargain was made and he got the cow      and he drove it backwards and forwards to show itbyandby he saw a man playing the bagpipes tweedledum tweedledee      the children followed him about and he appeared to be pocketing money on      all sides well thought mr vinegar if i had but that beautiful      instrument i should be the happiest man alive my fortune would be      madeso he went up to the man friend says he what a beautiful instrument      that is and what a deal of money you must make why yes said the      man i make a great deal of money to be sure and it is a wonderful      instrument oh cried mr vinegar how i should like to possess it       well said the man as you are a friend i dont much mind parting with      it you shall have it for that red cow done said the delighted mr      vinegar so the beautiful red cow was given for the bagpipeshe walked up and down with his purchase but it was in vain he tried to      play a tune and instead of pocketing pence the boys followed him      hooting laughing and peltingpoor mr vinegar his fingers grew very cold and just as he was leaving      the town he met a man with a fine thick pair of gloves oh my fingers      are so very cold said mr vinegar to himself now if i had but those      beautiful gloves i should be the happiest man alive he went up to the      man and said to him friend you seem to have a capital pair of gloves      there yes truly cried the man and my hands are as warm as possible      this cold november day well said mr vinegar i should like to have      them what will you give said the man as you are a friend i dont      much mind letting you have them for those bagpipes done cried mr      vinegar he put on the gloves and felt perfectly happy as he trudged      homewardsat last he grew very tired when he saw a man coming towards him with a      good stout stick in his handoh said mr vinegar that i had but that stick i should then be the      happiest man alive he said to the man friend what a rare good stick      you have got yes said the man i have used it for many a long mile      and a good friend it has been but if you have a fancy for it as you are      a friend i dont mind giving it to you for that pair of gloves mr      vinegars hands were so warm and his legs so tired that he gladly made      the exchangeas he drew near to the wood where he had left his wife he heard a parrot      on a tree calling out his name mr vinegar you foolish man you      blockhead you simpleton you went to the fair and laid out all your      money in buying a cow not content with that you changed it for bagpipes      on which you could not play and which were not worth onetenth of the      money you fool you you had no sooner got the bagpipes than you      changed them for the gloves which were not worth onequarter of the      money and when you had got the gloves you changed them for a poor      miserable stick and now for your forty guineas cow bagpipes and      gloves you have nothing to show but that poor miserable stick which you      might have cut in any hedge on this the bird laughed and laughed and      mr vinegar falling into a violent rage threw the stick at its head the      stick lodged in the tree and he returned to his wife without money cow      bagpipes gloves or stick and she instantly gave him such a sound      cudgelling that she almost broke every bone in his skin",

    "original_content": "there once lived a king and a queen as many a one has been they were long      married and had no children but at last a babyboy came to the queen when      the king was away in the far countries the queen would not christen the      boy till the king came back and she said we will just call him nix      nought nothing until his father comes home but it was long before he      came home and the boy had grown a nice little laddie at length the king      was on his way back but he had a big river to cross and there was a      whirlpool and he could not get over the water but a giant came up to      him and said ill carry you over but the king said whats your pay       o give me nix nought nothing and i will carry you over the water on my      back the king had never heard that his son was called nix nought      nothing and so he said o ill give you that and my thanks into the      bargain when the king got home again he was very happy to see his wife      again and his young son she told him that she had not given the child      any name but just nix nought nothing until he should come home again      himself the poor king was in a terrible case he said what have i done      i promised to give the giant who carried me over the river on his back      nix nought nothing the king and the queen were sad and sorry but they      said when the giant comes we will give him the henwifes boy he will      never know the difference the next day the giant came to claim the      kings promise and he sent for the henwifes boy and the giant went      away with the boy on his back he travelled till he came to a big stone      and there he sat down to rest he saidhidge hodge on my back what time of day is thatthe poor little boy said it is the time that my mother the henwife      takes up the eggs for the queens breakfastthe giant was very angry and dashed the boys head on the stone and      killed himso he went back in a tower of a temper and this time they gave him the      gardeners boy he went off with him on his back till they got to the      stone again when the giant sat down to rest and he saidhidge hodge on my back what time of day do you make thatthe gardeners boy said sure its the time that my mother takes up the      vegetables for the queens dinner then the giant was right wild and      dashed his brains out on the stonethen the giant went back to the kings house in a terrible temper and said      he would destroy them all if they did not give him nix nought nothing this      time they had to do it and when he came to the big stone the giant      said what time of day is that nix nought nothing said it is the time      that my father the king will be sitting down to supper the giant said      ive got the right one now and took nix nought nothing to his own house      and brought him up till he was a manthe giant had a bonny daughter and she and the lad grew very fond of each      other the giant said one day to nix nought nothing ive work for you      tomorrow there is a stable seven miles long and seven miles broad and      it has not been cleaned for seven years and you must clean it tomorrow      or i will have you for my supperthe giants daughter went out next morning with the lads breakfast and      found him in a terrible state for always as he cleaned out a bit it just      fell in again the giants daughter said she would help him and she cried      all the beasts in the field and all the fowls of the air and in a minute      they all came and carried away everything that was in the stable and made      it all clean before the giant came home he said shame on the wit that      helped you but i have a worse job for you tomorrow then he said to nix      nought nothing theres a lake seven miles long and seven miles deep      and seven miles broad and you must drain it tomorrow by nightfall or      else ill have you for my supper nix nought nothing began early next      morning and tried to lave the water with his pail but the lake was never      getting any less and he didnt know what to do but the giants daughter      called on all the fish in the sea to come and drink the water and very      soon they drank it dry when the giant saw the work done he was in a rage      and said ive a worse job for you tomorrow there is a tree seven      miles high and no branch on it till you get to the top and there is a      nest with seven eggs in it and you must bring down all the eggs without      breaking one or else ill have you for my supper at first the giants      daughter did not know how to help nix nought nothing but she cut off      first her fingers and then her toes and made steps of them and he clomb      the tree and got all the eggs safe till he came just to the bottom and      then one was broken so they determined to run away together and after the      giants daughter had tidied up her hair a bit and got her magic flask they      set out together as fast as they could run and they hadnt got but three      fields away when they looked back and saw the giant walking along at top      speed after them quick quick called out the giants daughter take      my comb from my hair and throw it down nix nought nothing took her comb      from her hair and threw it down and out of every one of its prongs there      sprung up a fine thick briar in the way of the giant you may be sure it      took him a long time to work his way through the briar bush and by the      time he was well through nix nought nothing and his sweetheart had run on      a tidy step away from him but he soon came along after them and was just      like to catch em up when the giants daughter called out to nix nought      nothing take my hair dagger and throw it down quick quick so nix      nought nothing threw down the hair dagger and out of it grew as quick as      lightning a thick hedge of sharp razors placed crisscross the giant had      to tread very cautiously to get through all this and meanwhile the young      lovers ran on and on and on till they were nearly out of sight but at      last the giant was through and it wasnt long before he was like to catch      them up but just as he was stretching out his hand to catch nix nought      nothing his daughter took out her magic flask and dashed it on the ground      and as it broke out of it welled a big big wave that grew and that grew      till it reached the giants waist and then his neck and when it got to      his head he was drowned dead and dead and dead indeed so he goes out      of the storybut nix nought nothing fled on till where do you think they came to why      to near the castle of nix nought nothings father and mother but the      giants daughter was so weary that she couldnt move a step further so      nix nought nothing told her to wait there while he went and found out a      lodging for the night and he went on towards the lights of the castle      and on the way he came to the cottage of the henwife whose boy had had      his brains dashed out by the giant now she knew nix nought nothing in a      moment and hated him because he was the cause of her sons death so when      he asked his way to the castle she put a spell upon him and when he got      to the castle no sooner was he let in than he fell down dead asleep upon      a bench in the hall the king and queen tried all they could do to wake      him up but all in vain so the king promised that if any lady could wake      him up she should marry him meanwhile the giants daughter was waiting      and waiting for him to come back and she went up into a tree to watch for      him the gardeners daughter going to draw water in the well saw the      shadow of the lady in the water and thought it was herself and said if      im so bonny if im so brave why do you send me to draw water so she      threw down her pail and went to see if she could wed the sleeping      stranger and she went to the henwife who taught her an unspelling catch      which would keep nix nought nothing awake as long as the gardeners      daughter liked so she went up to the castle and sang her catch and nix      nought nothing was wakened for a bit and they promised to wed him to the      gardeners daughter meanwhile the gardener went down to draw water from      the well and saw the shadow of the lady in the water so he looks up and      finds her and he brought the lady from the tree and led her into his      house and he told her that a stranger was to marry his daughter and took      her up to the castle and showed her the man and it was nix nought nothing      asleep in a chair and she saw him and cried to him waken waken and      speak to me but he would not waken and soon she criedthe king and the queen heard this and came to the bonny young lady and      she saidi cannot get nix nought nothing to speak to me for all that i can dothen were they greatly astonished when she spoke of nix nought nothing      and asked where he was and she said he that sits there in the chair       then they ran to him and kissed him and called him their own dear son so      they called for the gardeners daughter and made her sing her charm and      he wakened and told them all that the giants daughter had done for him      and of all her kindness then they took her in their arms and kissed her      and said she should now be their daughter for their son should marry her      but they sent for the henwife and put her to death and they lived happy      all their days",

    "original_content": "there was once upon a time a poor widow who had an only son named jack      and a cow named milkywhite and all they had to live on was the milk the      cow gave every morning which they carried to the market and sold but one      morning milkywhite gave no milk and they didnt know what to dowhat shall we do what shall we do said the widow wringing her handscheer up mother ill go and get work somewhere said jackweve tried that before and nobody would take you said his mother we      must sell milkywhite and with the money do something start shop or      somethingall right mother says jack its marketday today and ill soon sell      milkywhite and then well see what we can doso he took the cows halter in his hand and off he starts he hadnt gone      far when he met a funnylooking old man who said to him good morning      jackgood morning to you said jack and wondered how he knew his namewell jack and where are you off to said the manim going to market to sell our cow hereoh you look the proper sort of chap to sell cows said the man i      wonder if you know how many beans make fivetwo in each hand and one in your mouth says jack as sharp as a needleright you are said the man and here they are the very beans      themselves he went on pulling out of his pocket a number of      strangelooking beans as you are so sharp says he i dont mind doing      a swop with you your cow for these beanswalker says jack wouldnt you like itah you dont know what these beans are said the man if you plant      them overnight by morning they grow right up to the skyreally says jack you dont say soyes that is so and if it doesnt turn out to be true you can have your      cow backright says jack and hands him over milkywhites halter and pockets      the beansback goes jack home and as he hadnt gone very far it wasnt dusk by the      time he got to his doorwhat back jack said his mother i see you havent got milkywhite so      youve sold her how much did you get for heryoull never guess mother says jackno you dont say so good boy five pounds ten fifteen no it cant      be twentyi told you you couldnt guess what do you say to these beans theyre      magical plant them overnight andwhat says jacks mother have you been such a fool such a dolt such      an idiot as to give away my milkywhite the best milker in the parish      and prime beef to boot for a set of paltry beans take that take that      take that and as for your precious beans here they go out of the window      and now off with you to bed not a sup shall you drink and not a bit      shall you swallow this very nightso jack went upstairs to his little room in the attic and sad and sorry      he was to be sure as much for his mothers sake as for the loss of his      supperat last he dropped off to sleepwhen he woke up the room looked so funny the sun was shining into part      of it and yet all the rest was quite dark and shady so jack jumped up      and dressed himself and went to the window and what do you think he saw      why the beans his mother had thrown out of the window into the garden      had sprung up into a big beanstalk which went up and up and up till it      reached the sky so the man spoke truth after allthe beanstalk grew up quite close past jacks window so all he had to do      was to open it and give a jump on to the beanstalk which was made like a      big plaited ladder so jack climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he      climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till at last he      reached the sky and when he got there he found a long broad road going as      straight as a dart so he walked along and he walked along and he walked      along till he came to a great big tall house and on the doorstep there      was a great big tall womangood morning mum says jack quite politelike could you be so kind      as to give me some breakfast for he hadnt had anything to eat you      know the night before and was as hungry as a hunterits breakfast you want is it says the great big tall woman its      breakfast youll be if you dont move off from here my man is an ogre and      theres nothing he likes better than boys broiled on toast youd better      be moving on or hell soon be comingoh please mum do give me something to eat mum ive had nothing to eat      since yesterday morning really and truly mum says jack i may as well      be broiled as die of hungerwell the ogres wife wasnt such a bad sort after all so she took jack      into the kitchen and gave him a junk of bread and cheese and a jug of      milk but jack hadnt half finished these when thump thump thump the      whole house began to tremble with the noise of someone cominggoodness gracious me its my old man said the ogres wife what on      earth shall i do here come quick and jump in here and she bundled jack      into the oven just as the ogre came inhe was a big one to be sure at his belt he had three calves strung up by      the heels and he unhooked them and threw them down on the table and said      here wife broil me a couple of these for breakfast ah whats this i      smellnonsense dear said his wife youre dreaming or perhaps you smell      the scraps of that little boy you liked so much for yesterdays dinner      here go you and have a wash and tidy up and by the time you come back      your breakfastll be ready for youso the ogre went off and jack was just going to jump out of the oven and      run off when the woman told him not wait till hes asleep says she      he always has a snooze after breakfastwell the ogre had his breakfast and after that he goes to a big chest      and takes out of it a couple of bags of gold and sits down counting them      till at last his head began to nod and he began to snore till the whole      house shook againthen jack crept out on tiptoe from his oven and as he was passing the      ogre he took one of the bags of gold under his arm and off he pelters      till he came to the beanstalk and then he threw down the bag of gold      which of course fell in to his mothers garden and then he climbed down      and climbed down till at last he got home and told his mother and showed      her the gold and said well mother wasnt i right about the beans they      are really magical you seeso they lived on the bag of gold for some time but at last they came to      the end of that so jack made up his mind to try his luck once more up at      the top of the beanstalk so one fine morning he got up early and got on      to the beanstalk and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he      climbed and he climbed and he climbed till at last he got on the road      again and came to the great big tall house he had been to before there      sure enough was the great big tall woman astanding on the doorstepgood morning mum says jack as bold as brass could you be so good as      to give me something to eatgo away my boy said the big tall woman or else my man will eat you      up for breakfast but arent you the youngster who came here once before      do you know that very day my man missed one of his bags of goldthats strange mum says jack i dare say i could tell you something      about that but im so hungry i cant speak till ive had something to      eatwell the big tall woman was that curious that she took him in and gave him      something to eat but he had scarcely begun munching it as slowly as he      could when thump thump thump they heard the giants footstep and his      wife hid jack away in the ovenall happened as it did before in came the ogre as he did before said      feefifofum and had his breakfast off three broiled oxen then he      said wife bring me the hen that lays the golden eggs so she brought      it and the ogre said lay and it laid an egg all of gold and then the      ogre began to nod his head and to snore till the house shookthen jack crept out of the oven on tiptoe and caught hold of the golden      hen and was off before you could say jack robinson but this time the      hen gave a cackle which woke the ogre and just as jack got out of the      house he heard him calling wife wife what have you done with my golden      henand the wife said why my dearbut that was all jack heard for he rushed off to the beanstalk and      climbed down like a house on fire and when he got home he showed his      mother the wonderful hen and said lay to it and it laid a golden egg      every time he said laywell jack was not content and it wasnt very long before he determined      to have another try at his luck up there at the top of the beanstalk so      one fine morning he got up early and went on to the beanstalk and he      climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till he got to the      top but this time he knew better than to go straight to the ogres house      and when he got near it he waited behind a bush till he saw the ogres      wife come out with a pail to get some water and then he crept into the      house and got into the copper he hadnt been there long when he heard      thump thump thump as before and in come the ogre and his wifefeefifofum i smell the blood of an englishman cried out the ogre      i smell him wife i smell himdo you my dearie says the ogres wife then if its that little rogue      that stole your gold and the hen that laid the golden eggs hes sure to      have got into the oven and they both rushed to the oven but jack wasnt      there luckily and the ogres wife said there you are again with your      feefifofum why of course its the laddie you caught last night that      ive broiled for your breakfast how forgetful i am and how careless you      are not to tell the difference between a live un and a dead unso the ogre sat down to the breakfast and ate it but every now and then      he would mutter well i could have sworn   and hed get up      and search the larder and the cupboards and everything only luckily he      didnt think of the copperafter breakfast was over the ogre called out wife wife bring me my      golden harp so she brought it and put it on the table before him then      he said sing and the golden harp sang most beautifully and it went on      singing till the ogre fell asleep and commenced to snore like thunderthen jack lifted up the copperlid very quietly and got down like a mouse      and crept on hands and knees till he got to the table when he got up and      caught hold of the golden harp and dashed with it towards the door but      the harp called out quite loud master master and the ogre woke up      just in time to see jack running off with his harpjack ran as fast as he could and the ogre came rushing after and would      soon have caught him only jack had a start and dodged him a bit and knew      where he was going when he got to the beanstalk the ogre was not more      than twenty yards away when suddenly he saw jack disappear like and when      he got up to the end of the road he saw jack underneath climbing down for      dear life well the ogre didnt like trusting himself to such a ladder      and he stood and waited so jack got another start but just then the harp      cried out master master and the ogre swung himself down on to the      beanstalk which shook with his weight down climbs jack and after him      climbed the ogre by this time jack had climbed down and climbed down and      climbed down till he was very nearly home so he called out mother      mother bring me an axe bring me an axe and his mother came rushing out      with the axe in her hand but when she came to the beanstalk she stood      stock still with fright for there she saw the ogre just coming down below      the cloudsbut jack jumped down and got hold of the axe and gave a chop at the      beanstalk which cut it half in two the ogre felt the beanstalk shake and      quiver so he stopped to see what was the matter then jack gave another      chop with the axe and the beanstalk was cut in two and began to topple      over then the ogre fell down and broke his crown and the beanstalk came      toppling afterthen jack showed his mother his golden harp and what with showing that      and selling the golden eggs jack and his mother became very rich and he      married a great princess and they lived happy ever after",

    "original_content": "there was once a very learned man in the northcountry who knew all the      languages under the sun and who was acquainted with all the mysteries of      creation he had one big book bound in black calf and clasped with iron      and with iron corners and chained to a table which was made fast to the      floor and when he read out of this book he unlocked it with an iron key      and none but he read from it for it contained all the secrets of the      spiritual world it told how many angels there were in heaven and how      they marched in their ranks and sang in their quires and what were their      several functions and what was the name of each great angel of might and      it told of the demons how many of them there were and what were their      several powers and their labours and their names and how they might be      summoned and how tasks might be imposed on them and how they might be      chained to be as slaves to mannow the master had a pupil who was but a foolish lad and he acted as      servant to the great master but never was he suffered to look into the      black book hardly to enter the private roomone day the master was out and then the lad as curious as could be      hurried to the chamber where his master kept his wondrous apparatus for      changing copper into gold and lead into silver and where was his mirror      in which he could see all that was passing in the world and where was the      shell which when held to the ear whispered all the words that were being      spoken by anyone the master desired to know about the lad tried in vain      with the crucibles to turn copper and lead into gold and silver he      looked long and vainly into the mirror smoke and clouds passed over it      but he saw nothing plain and the shell to his ear produced only      indistinct murmurings like the breaking of distant seas on an unknown      shore i can do nothing he said as i dont know the right words to      utter and they are locked up in yon bookhe looked round and see the book was unfastened the master had      forgotten to lock it before he went out the boy rushed to it and      unclosed the volume it was written with red and black ink and much of it      he could not understand but he put his finger on a line and spelled it      throughat once the room was darkened and the house trembled a clap of thunder      rolled through the passage and the old room and there stood before him a      horrible horrible form breathing fire and with eyes like burning lamps      it was the demon beelzebub whom he had called up to serve himset me a task said he with a voice like the roaring of an iron      furnacethe boy only trembled and his hair stood upset me a task or i shall strangle theebut the lad could not speak then the evil spirit stepped towards him and      putting forth his hands touched his throat the fingers burned his flesh      set me a taskwater yon flower cried the boy in despair pointing to a geranium which      stood in a pot on the floor instantly the spirit left the room but in      another instant he returned with a barrel on his back and poured its      contents over the flower and again and again he went and came and poured      more and more water till the floor of the room was ankledeepenough enough gasped the lad but the demon heeded him not the lad      didnt know the words by which to send him away and still he fetched      waterit rose to the boys knees and still more water was poured it mounted to      his waist and beelzebub still kept on bringing barrels full it rose to      his armpits and he scrambled to the tabletop and now the water in the      room stood up to the window and washed against the glass and swirled      around his feet on the table it still rose it reached his breast in      vain he cried the evil spirit would not be dismissed and to this day he      would have been pouring water and would have drowned all yorkshire but      the master remembered on his journey that he had not locked his book and      therefore returned and at the moment when the water was bubbling about      the pupils chin rushed into the room and spoke the words which cast      beelzebub back into his fiery home",

because he      had lots of books and he used to read every day about them and when he      read about some pretty young women he used to go mad to see some of them      till one day when his father was out cutting wood he told his mother      that he wished to go away to look for his living in some other country      and to see some other people besides them two and he said i see nothing      at all here but great trees around me and if i stay here maybe i shall      go mad before i see anything the young mans father was out all this      time when this talk was going on between him and his poor old motherthe old woman begins by saying to her son before leaving well well my      poor boy if you want to go its better for you to go and god be with      you the old woman thought for the best when she said that but      stop a bit before you go which would you like best for me to make you a      little cake and bless you or a big cake and curse you dear dear       said he make me a big cake maybe i shall be hungry on the road the      old woman made the big cake and she went on top of the house and she      cursed him as far as she could see himhe presently meets with his father and the old man says to him where      are you going my poor boy when the son told the father the same tale as      he told his mother well says his father im sorry to see you going      away but if youve made your mind to go its better for you to gothe poor lad had not gone far when his father called him back then the      old man drew out of his pocket a golden snuffbox and said to him here      take this little box and put it in your pocket and be sure not to open      it till you are near your death and away went poor jack upon his road      and walked till he was tired and hungry for he had eaten all his cake      upon the road and by this time night was upon him so he could hardly see      his way before him he could see some light a long way before him and he      made up to it and found the back door and knocked at it till one of the      maidservants came and asked him what he wanted he said that night was on      him and he wanted to get some place to sleep the maidservant called him      in to the fire and gave him plenty to eat good meat and bread and beer      and as he was eating his food by the fire there came the young lady to      look at him and she loved him well and he loved her and the young lady      ran to tell her father and said there was a pretty young man in the back      kitchen and immediately the gentleman came to him and questioned him      and asked what work he could do jack said the silly fellow that he      could do anything he meant that he could do any foolish bit of work      that would be wanted about the housewell says the gentleman to him if you can do anything at eight      oclock in the morning i must have a great lake and some ofthe largest      manofwar vessels sailing before my mansion and one of the largest      vessels must fire a royal salute and the last round must break the leg of      the bed where my young daughter is sleeping and if you dont do that you      will have to forfeit your lifeall right said jack and away he went to his bed and said his prayers      quietly and slept till it was near eight oclock and he had hardly any      time to think what he was to do till all of a sudden he remembered about      the little golden box that his father gave him and he said to himself      well well i never was so near my death as i am now and then he felt      in his pocket and drew the little box out and when he opened it out      there hopped three little red men and asked jack what is your will with      us well said jack i want a great lake and some of the largest      manofwar vessels in the world before this mansion and one of the      largest vessels to fire a royal salute and the last round to break one of      the legs of the bed where this young lady is sleeping all right said      the little men go to sleepjack had hardly time to bring the words out of his mouth to tell the      little men what to do but what it struck eight oclock when bang bang      went one of the largest manofwar vessels and it made jack jump out of      bed to look through the window and i can assure you it was a wonderful      sight for him to see after being so long with his father and mother      living in a woodby this time jack dressed himself and said his prayers and came down      laughing for he was proud he was because the thing was done so well      the gentleman comes to him and says to him well my young man i must      say that you are very clever indeed come and have some breakfast and      the gentleman tells him now there are two more things you have to do      and then you shall have my daughter in marriage jack gets his breakfast      and has a good squint at the young lady and also she at himthe other thing that the gentleman told him to do was to fell all the      great trees for miles around by eight oclock in the morning and to make      my long story short it was done and it pleased the gentleman well the      gentleman said to him the other thing you have to do and it was      the last thing you must get me a great castle standing on twelve      golden pillars and there must come regiments of soldiers and go through      their drill at eight oclock the commanding officer must say shoulder      up all right said jack when the third and last morning came the      third great feat was finished and he had the young daughter in marriage      but oh dear there is worse to come yetthe gentleman now makes a large hunting party and invites all the      gentlemen around the country to it and to see the castle as well and by      this time jack has a beautiful horse and a scarlet dress to go with them      on that morning his valet when putting jacks clothes by after changing      them to go a hunting put his hand in one of jacks waistcoatpockets and      pulled out the little golden snuffbox as poor jack left behind in a      mistake and that man opened the little box and there hopped the three      little red men out and asked him what he wanted with them well said      the valet to them i want this castle to be moved from this place far and      far across the sea all right said the little red men to him do you      wish to go with it yes said he well get up said they to him and      away they went far and far over the great seanow the grand hunting party comes back and the castle upon the twelve      golden pillars had disappeared to the great disappointment of those      gentlemen as did not see it before that poor silly jack is threatened by      taking his beautiful young wife from him for taking them in in the way he      did but the gentleman at last made an agreement with him and he is to      have a twelvemonths and a day to look for it and off he goes with a good      horse and money in his pocketnow poor jack goes in search of his missing castle over hills dales      valleys and mountains through woolly woods and sheepwalks further than      i can tell you or ever intend to tell you until at last he comes up to      the place where lives the king of all the little mice in the world there      was one of the little mice on sentry at the front gate going up to the      palace and did try to stop jack from going in he asked the little mouse      where does the king live i should like to see him this one sent      another with him to show him the place and when the king saw him he      called him in and the king questioned him and asked him where he was      going that way well jack told him all the truth that he had lost the      great castle and was going to look for it and he had a whole      twelvemonths and a day to find it out and jack asked him whether he knew      anything about it and the king said no but i am the king of all the      little mice in the world and i will call them all up in the morning and      maybe they have seen something of itthen jack got a good meal and bed and in the morning he and the king went      on to the fields and the king called all the mice together and asked      them whether they had seen the great beautiful castle standing on golden      pillars and all the little mice said no there was none of them had seen      it the old king said to him that he had two other brothers one is the      king of all the frogs and my other brother who is the oldest he is the      king of all the birds in the world and if you go there may be they know      something about the missing castle the king said to him leave your      horse here with me till you come back and take one of my best horses      under you and give this cake to my brother he will know then who you got      it from mind and tell him i am well and should like dearly to see him       and then the king and jack shook hands togetherand when jack was going through the gates the little mouse asked him      should he go with him and jack said to him no i shall get myself into      trouble with the king and the little thing told him it will be better      for you to let me go with you maybe i shall do some good to you some time      without you knowing it jump up then and the little mouse ran up the      horses leg and made it dance and jack put the mouse in his pocketnow jack after wishing good morning to the king and pocketing the little      mouse which was on sentry trudged on his way and such a long way he had      to go and this was his first day at last he found the place and there      was one of the frogs on sentry and gun upon his shoulder and did try to      hinder jack from going in but when jack said to him that he wanted to see      the king he allowed him to pass and jack made up to the door the king      came out and asked him his business and jack told him all from beginning      to end well well come in he gets good entertainment that night and      in the morning the king made such a funny sound and collected all the      frogs in the world and he asked them did they know or see anything of a      castle that stood upon twelve golden pillars and they all made a curious      sound krokro krokro and said nojack had to take another horse and a cake to this kings brother who is      the king of all the fowls of the air and as jack was going through the      gates the little frog that was on sentry asked john should he go with      him jack refused him for a bit but at last he told him to jump up and      jack put him in his other waistcoat pocket and away he went again on his      great long journey it was three times as long this time as it was the      first day however he found the place and there was a fine bird on      sentry and jack passed him and he never said a word to him and he      talked with the king and told him everything all about the castle      well said the king to him you shall know in the morning from my      birds whether they know anything or not jack put up his horse in the      stable and then went to bed after having something to eat and when he      got up in the morning the king and he went on to some field and there the      king made some funny noise and there came all the fowls that were in all      the world and the king asked them did they see the fine castle and      all the birds answered no well said the king where is the great      bird they had to wait then for a long time for the eagle to make his      appearance when at last he came all in a perspiration after sending two      little birds high up in the sky to whistle on him to make all the haste he      possibly could the king asked the great bird did he see the great      castle and the bird said yes i came from there where it now is       well says the king to him this young gentleman has lost it and you      must go with him back to it but stop till you get a bit of something to      eat firstthey killed a thief and sent the best part of it to feed the eagle on his      journey over the seas and had to carry jack on his back now when they      came in sight of the castle they did not know what to do to get the      little golden box well the little mouse said to them leave me down      and i will get the little box for you so the mouse stole into the      castle and got hold of the box and when he was coming down the stairs      it fell down and he was very near being caught he came running out with      it laughing his best have you got it jack said to him he said      yes and off they went back again and left the castle behindas they were all of them jack mouse frog and eagle passing over the      great sea they fell to quarrelling about which it was that got the little      box till down it slipped into the water it was by them looking at it      and handing it from one hand to the other that they dropped the little box      to the bottom of the sea well well said the frog i knew that i      would have to do something so you had better let me go down in the      water and they let him go and he was down for three days and three      nights and up he comes and shows his nose and little mouth out of the      water and all of them asked him did he get it and he told them no      well what are you doing there then nothing at all he said only i      want my full breath and the poor little frog went down the second time      and he was down for a day and a night and up he brings itand away they did go after being there four days and nights and after a      long tug over seas and mountains arrive at the palace of the old king      who is the master of all the birds in the world and the king is very      proud to see them and has a hearty welcome and a long conversation jack      opens the little box and told the little men to go back and to bring the      castle here to them and all of you make as much haste back again as you      possibly canthe three little men went off and when they came near the castle they      were afraid to go to it till the gentleman and lady and all the servants      were gone out to some dance and there was no one left behind there only      the cook and another maid with her and the little red men asked them      which would they rather go or stop behind and they both said i      will go with you and the little men told them to run upstairs quick      they were no sooner up and in one of the drawingrooms than here comes      just in sight the gentleman and lady and all the servants but it was too      late off the castle went at full speed with the women laughing at them      through the window while they made motions for them to stop but all to      no purposethey were nine days on their journey in which they did try to keep the      sunday holy when one of the little men turned to be the priest the other      the clerk and third presided at the organ and the women were the      singers for they had a grand chapel in the castle already very      remarkable there was a discord made in the music and one of the little      men ran up one of the organpipes to see where the bad sound came from      when he found out it only happened to be that the two women were laughing      at the little red man stretching his little legs full length on the bass      pipes also his two arms the same time with his little red nightcap      which he never forgot to wear and what they never witnessed before could      not help calling forth some good merriment while on the face of the deep      and poor thing through them not going on with what they begun with they      very near came to danger as the castle was once very near sinking in the      middle of the seaat length after a merry journey they come again to jack and the king      the king was quite struck with the sight of the castle and going up the      golden stairs went to see the insidethe king was very much pleased with the castle but poor jacks time of a      twelvemonths and a day was drawing to a close and he wishing to go home      to his young wife gives orders to the three little men to get ready by      the next morning at eight oclock to be off to the next brother and to      stop there for one night also to proceed from there to the last or the      youngest brother the master of all the mice in the world in such place      where the castle shall be left under his care until its sent for jack      takes a farewell of the king and thanks him very much for his      hospitalityaway went jack and his castle again and stopped one night in that place      and away they went again to the third place and there left the castle      under his care as jack had to leave the castle behind he had to take to      his own horse which he left there when he first startednow poor jack leaves his castle behind and faces towards home and after      having so much merriment with the three brothers every night jack became      sleepy on horseback and would have lost the road if it was not for the      little men aguiding him at last he arrived weary and tired and they did      not seem to receive him with any kindness whatever because he had not      found the stolen castle and to make it worse he was disappointed in not      seeing his young and beautiful wife to come and meet him through being      hindered by her parents but that did not stop long jack put full power      on and despatched the little men off to bring the castle from there and      they soon got therejack shook hands with the king and returned many thanks for his kingly      kindness in minding the castle for him and then jack instructed the      little men to spur up and put speed on and off they went and were not      long before they reached their journeys end when out comes the young      wife to meet him with a fine lump of a young son and they all lived happy      ever afterwards",

    "title": "THE STORY OF THE THREE BEARS",
    "original_content": "once upon a time there were three bears who lived together in a house of      their own in a wood one of them was a little small wee bear and one      was a middlesized bear and the other was a great huge bear they had      each a pot for their porridge a little pot for the little small wee      bear and a middlesized pot for the middle bear and a great pot for the      great huge bear and they had each a chair to sit in a little chair for      the little small wee bear and a middlesized chair for the middle bear      and a great chair for the great huge bear and they had each a bed to      sleep in a little bed for the little small wee bear and a middlesized      bed for the middle bear and a great bed for the great huge bearone day after they had made the porridge for their breakfast and poured      it into their porridgepots they walked out into the wood while the      porridge was cooling that they might not burn their mouths by beginning      too soon to eat it and while they were walking a little old woman came      to the house she could not have been a good honest old woman for first      she looked in at the window and then she peeped in at the keyhole and      seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch the door was not      fastened because the bears were good bears who did nobody any harm and      never suspected that anybody would harm them so the little old woman      opened the door and went in and well pleased she was when she saw the      porridge on the table if she had been a good little old woman she would      have waited till the bears came home and then perhaps they would have      asked her to breakfast for they were good bears a little rough or      so as the manner of bears is but for all that very goodnatured and      hospitable but she was an impudent bad old woman and set about helping      herselfso first she tasted the porridge of the great huge bear and that was too      hot for her and she said a bad word about that and then she tasted the      porridge of the middle bear and that was too cold for her and she said a      bad word about that too and then she went to the porridge of the little      small wee bear and tasted that and that was neither too hot nor too      cold but just right and she liked it so well that she ate it all up      but the naughty old woman said a bad word about the little porridgepot      because it did not hold enough for herthen the little old woman sate down in the chair of the great huge bear      and that was too hard for her and then she sate down in the chair of the      middle bear and that was too soft for her and then she sate down in the      chair of the little small wee bear and that was neither too hard nor      too soft but just right so she seated herself in it and there she sate      till the bottom of the chair came out and down she came plump upon the      ground and the naughty old woman said a wicked word about that toothen the little old woman went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the      three bears slept and first she lay down upon the bed of the great huge      bear but that was too high at the head for her and next she lay down      upon the bed of the middle bear and that was too high at the foot for      her and then she lay down upon the bed of the little small wee bear      and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot but just      right so she covered herself up comfortably and lay there till she fell      fast asleepby this time the three bears thought their porridge would be cool enough      so they came home to breakfast now the little old woman had left the      spoon of the great huge bear standing in his porridgesomebody has been at my porridgesaid the great huge bear in his great rough gruff voice and when the      middle bear looked at his he saw that the spoon was standing in it too      they were wooden spoons if they had been silver ones the naughty old      woman would have put them in her pocketsomebody has been at my porridgesaid the middle bear in his middle voicethen the little small wee bear looked at his and there was the spoon in      the porridgepot but the porridge was all gonesomebody has been at my porridge and has eaten it all upsaid the little small wee bear in his little small wee voiceupon this the three bears seeing that some one had entered their house      and eaten up the little small wee bears breakfast began to look about      them now the little old woman had not put the hard cushion straight when      she rose from the chair of the great huge bearsomebody has been sitting in my chairsaid the great huge bear in his great rough gruff voiceand the little old woman had squatted down the soft cushion of the middle      bearsomebody has been sitting in my chairsaid the middle bear in his middle voiceand you know what the little old woman had done to the third chairsomebody has been sitting in my chair and has sate the bottom out of itsaid the little small wee bear in his little small wee voicethen the three bears thought it necessary that they should make farther      search so they went upstairs into their bedchamber now the little old      woman had pulled the pillow of the great huge bear out of its placesomebody has been lying in my bedsaid the great huge bear in his great rough gruff voiceand the little old woman had pulled the bolster of the middle bear out of      its placesomebody has been lying in my bedsaid the middle bear in his middle voiceand when the little small wee bear came to look at his bed there was      the bolster in its place and the pillow in its place upon the bolster      and upon the pillow was the little old womans ugly dirty head which      was not in its place for she had no business theresomebody has been lying in my bed and here she issaid the little small wee bear in his little small wee voicethe little old woman had heard in her sleep the great rough gruff voice      of the great huge bear but she was so fast asleep that it was no more to      her than the roaring of wind or the rumbling of thunder and she had      heard the middle voice of the middle bear but it was only as if she had      heard some one speaking in a dream but when she heard the little small      wee voice of the little small wee bear it was so sharp and so shrill      that it awakened her at once up she started and when she saw the three      bears on one side of the bed she tumbled herself out at the other and      ran to the window now the window was open because the bears like good      tidy bears as they were always opened their bedchamber window when they      got up in the morning out the little old woman jumped and whether she      broke her neck in the fall or ran into the wood and was lost there or      found her way out of the wood and was taken up by the constable and sent      to the house of correction for a vagrant as she was i cannot tell but      the three bears never saw anything more of her",

    "title": "JACK THE GIANT-KILLER",
    "original_content": "when good king arthur reigned there lived near the lands end of england      in the county of cornwall a farmer who had one only son called jack he      was brisk and of a ready lively wit so that nobody or nothing could worst      himin those days the mount of cornwall was kept by a huge giant named      cormoran he was eighteen feet in height and about three yards round the      waist of a fierce and grim countenance the terror of all the      neighbouring towns and villages he lived in a cave in the midst of the      mount and whenever he wanted food he would wade over to the mainland      where he would furnish himself with whatever came in his way everybody at      his approach ran out of their houses while he seized on their cattle      making nothing of carrying halfadozen oxen on his back at a time and as      for their sheep and hogs he would tie them round his waist like a bunch      of tallowdips he had done this for many years so that all cornwall was      in despairone day jack happened to be at the townhall when the magistrates were      sitting in council about the giant he asked what reward will be given      to the man who kills cormoran the giants treasure they said will      be the reward quoth jack then let me undertake itso he got a horn shovel and pickaxe and went over to the mount in the      beginning of a dark winters evening when he fell to work and before      morning had dug a pit twentytwo feet deep and nearly as broad covering      it over with long sticks and straw then he strewed a little mould over      it so that it appeared like plain ground jack then placed himself on the      opposite side of the pit farthest from the giants lodging and just at      the break of day he put the horn to his mouth and blew tantivy      tantivy this noise roused the giant who rushed from his cave crying      you incorrigible villain are you come here to disturb my rest you shall      pay dearly for this satisfaction i will have and this it shall be i      will take you whole and broil you for breakfast he had no sooner uttered      this than he tumbled into the pit and made the very foundations of the      mount to shake oh giant quoth jack where are you now oh faith      you are gotten now into lobs pound where i will surely plague you for      your threatening words what do you think now of broiling me for your      breakfast will no other diet serve you but poor jack then having      tantalised the giant for a while he gave him a most weighty knock with      his pickaxe on the very crown of his head and killed him on the spotjack then filled up the pit with earth and went to search the cave which      he found contained much treasure when the magistrates heard of this they      made a declaration he should henceforth be termedand presented him with a sword and a belt on which were written these      words embroidered in letters of goldthe news of jacks victory soon spread over all the west of england so      that another giant named blunderbore hearing of it vowed to be revenged      on jack if ever he should light on him this giant was the lord of an      enchanted castle situated in the midst of a lonesome wood now jack about      four months afterwards walking near this wood in his journey to wales      being weary seated himself near a pleasant fountain and fell fast asleep      while he was sleeping the giant coming there for water discovered him      and knew him to be the farfamed jack the giantkiller by the lines      written on the belt without ado he took jack on his shoulders and      carried him towards his castle now as they passed through a thicket the      rustling of the boughs awakened jack who was strangely surprised to find      himself in the clutches of the giant his terror was only begun for on      entering the castle he saw the ground strewed with human bones and the      giant told him his own would ere long be among them after this the giant      locked poor jack in an immense chamber leaving him there while he went to      fetch another giant his brother living in the same wood who might share      in the meal on jackafter waiting some time jack on going to the window beheld afar off the      two giants coming towards the castle now quoth jack to himself my      death or my deliverance is at hand now there were strong cords in a      corner of the room in which jack was and two of these he took and made a      strong noose at the end and while the giants were unlocking the iron gate      of the castle he threw the ropes over each of their heads then he drew      the other ends across a beam and pulled with all his might so that he      throttled them then when he saw they were black in the face he slid      down the rope and drawing his sword slew them both then taking the      giants keys and unlocking the rooms he found three fair ladies tied by      the hair of their heads almost starved to death sweet ladies quoth      jack i have destroyed this monster and his brutish brother and obtained      your liberties this said he presented them with the keys and so      proceeded on his journey to walesjack made the best of his way by travelling as fast as he could but lost      his road and was benighted and could find any habitation until coming      into a narrow valley he found a large house and in order to get shelter      took courage to knock at the gate but what was his surprise when there      came forth a monstrous giant with two heads yet he did not appear so      fiery as the others were for he was a welsh giant and what he did was by      private and secret malice under the false show of friendship jack having      told his condition to the giant was shown into a bedroom where in the      dead of night he heard his host in another apartment muttering these      wordssayst thou so quoth jack that is like one of your welsh tricks yet      i hope to be cunning enough for you then getting out of bed he laid a      billet in the bed in his stead and hid himself in a corner of the room      at the dead time of the night in came the welsh giant who struck several      heavy blows on the bed with his club thinking he had broken every bone in      jacks skin the next morning jack laughing in his sleeve gave him      hearty thanks for his nights lodging how have you rested quoth the      giant did you not feel anything in the night no quoth jack      nothing but a rat which gave me two or three slaps with her tail with      that greatly wondering the giant led jack to breakfast bringing him a      bowl containing four gallons of hasty pudding being loth to let the giant      think it too much for him jack put a large leather bag under his loose      coat in such a way that he could convey the pudding into it without its      being perceived then telling the giant he would show him a trick taking      a knife jack ripped open the bag and out came all the hasty pudding      whereupon saying odds splutters hur nails hur can do that trick      hurself the monster took the knife and ripping open his belly fell      down deadnow it happened in these days that king arthurs only son asked his      father to give him a large sum of money in order that he might go and      seek his fortune in the principality of wales where lived a beautiful      lady possessed with seven evil spirits the king did his best to persuade      his son from it but in vain so at last gave way and the prince set out      with two horses one loaded with money the other for himself to ride      upon now after several days travel he came to a markettown in wales      where he beheld a vast crowd of people gathered together the prince asked      the reason of it and was told that they had arrested a corpse for several      large sums of money which the deceased owed when he died the prince      replied that it was a pity creditors should be so cruel and said go      bury the dead and let his creditors come to my lodging and there their      debts shall be paid they came in such great numbers that before night      he had only twopence left for himselfnow jack the giantkiller coming that way was so taken with the      generosity of the prince that he desired to be his servant this being      agreed upon the next morning they set forward on their journey together      when as they were riding out of the town an old woman called after the      prince saying he has owed me twopence these seven years pray pay me as      well as the rest putting his hand to his pocket the prince gave the      woman all he had left so that after their days food which cost what      small spell jack had by him they were without a penny between themwhen the sun got low the kings son said jack since we have no money      where can we lodge this nightbut jack replied master well do well enough for i have an uncle lives      within two miles of this place he is a huge and monstrous giant with      three heads hell fight five hundred men in armour and make them to fly      before him alas quoth the prince what shall we do there hell      certainly chop us up at a mouthful nay we are scarce enough to fill one      of his hollow teethit is no matter for that quoth jack i myself will go before and      prepare the way for you therefore stop here and wait till i return jack      then rode away at full speed and coming to the gate of the castle he      knocked so loud that he made the neighbouring hills resound the giant      roared out at this like thunder whos therejack answered none but your poor cousin jackquoth he what news with my poor cousin jackhe replied dear uncle heavy news god wotprithee quoth the giant what heavy news can come to me i am a giant      with three heads and besides thou knowest i can fight five hundred men in      armour and make them fly like chaff before the windoh but quoth jack heres the kings son acoming with a thousand men      in armour to kill you and destroy all that you haveoh cousin jack said the giant this is heavy news indeed i will      immediately run and hide myself and thou shalt lock bolt and bar me in      and keep the keys until the prince is gone having secured the giant      jack fetched his master when they made themselves heartily merry whilst      the poor giant lay trembling in a vault under the groundearly in the morning jack furnished his master with a fresh supply of gold      and silver and then sent him three miles forward on his journey at which      time the prince was pretty well out of the smell of the giant jack then      returned and let the giant out of the vault who asked what he should      give him for keeping the castle from destruction why quoth jack i      want nothing but the old coat and cap together with the old rusty sword      and slippers which are at your beds head quoth the giant you know not      what you ask they are the most precious things i have the coat will keep      you invisible the cap will tell you all you want to know the sword cuts      asunder whatever you strike and the shoes are of extraordinary swiftness      but you have been very serviceable to me therefore take them with all my      heart jack thanked his uncle and then went off with them he soon      overtook his master and they quickly arrived at the house of the lady the      prince sought who finding the prince to be a suitor prepared a splendid      banquet for him after the repast was concluded she told him she had a      task for him she wiped his mouth with a handkerchief saying you must      show me that handkerchief tomorrow morning or else you will lose your      head with that she put it in her bosom the prince went to bed in great      sorrow but jacks cap of knowledge informed him how it was to be      obtained in the middle of the night she called upon her familiar spirit      to carry her to lucifer but jack put on his coat of darkness and his      shoes of swiftness and was there as soon as she was when she entered the      place of the old one she gave the handkerchief to old lucifer who laid      it upon a shelf whence jack took it and brought it to his master who      showed it to the lady next day and so saved his life on that day she      gave the prince a kiss and told him he must show her the lips tomorrow      morning that she kissed last night or lose his headah he replied if you kiss none but mine i willthat is neither here nor there said she if you do not deaths your      portionat midnight she went as before and was angry with old lucifer for letting      the handkerchief go but now quoth she i will be too hard for the      kings son for i will kiss thee and he is to show me thy lips which      she did and jack when she was not standing by cut off lucifers head      and brought it under his invisible coat to his master who the next      morning pulled it out by the horns before the lady this broke the      enchantment and the evil spirit left her and she appeared in all her      beauty they were married the next morning and soon after went to the      court of king arthur where jack for his many great exploits was made one      of the knights of the round tablejack soon went searching for giants again but he had not ridden far when      he saw a cave near the entrance of which he beheld a giant sitting upon a      block of timber with a knotted iron club by his side his goggle eyes      were like flames of fire his countenance grim and ugly and his cheeks      like a couple of large flitches of bacon while the bristles of his beard      resembled rods of iron wire and the locks that hung down upon his brawny      shoulders were like curled snakes or hissing adders jack alighted from      his horse and putting on the coat of darkness went up close to the      giant and said softly oh are you there it will not be long before i      take you fast by the beard the giant all this while could not see him      on account of his invisible coat so that jack coming up close to the      monster struck a blow with his sword at his head but missing his aim      he cut off the nose instead at this the giant roared like claps of      thunder and began to lay about him with his iron club like one stark mad      but jack running behind drove his sword up to the hilt in the giants      back so that he fell down dead this done jack cut off the giants head      and sent it with his brothers also to king arthur by a waggoner he      hired for that purposejack now resolved to enter the giants cave in search of his treasure      and passing along through a great many windings and turnings he came at      length to a large room paved with freestone at the upper end of which was      a boiling caldron and on the right hand a large table at which the giant      used to dine then he came to a window barred with iron through which he      looked and beheld a vast number of miserable captives who seeing him      cried out alas young man art thou come to be one amongst us in this      miserable denay quoth jack but pray tell me what is the meaning of your      captivitywe are kept here said one till such time as the giants have a wish to      feast and then the fattest among us is slaughtered and many are the      times they have dined upon murdered mensay you so quoth jack and straightway unlocked the gate and let them      free who all rejoiced like condemned men at sight of a pardon then      searching the giants coffers he shared the gold and silver equally      amongst them and took them to a neighbouring castle where they all      feasted and made merry over their deliverancebut in the midst of all this mirth a messenger brought news that one      thunderdell a giant with two heads having heard of the death of his      kinsmen had come from the northern dales to be revenged on jack and was      within a mile of the castle the country people flying before him like      chaff but jack was not a bit daunted and said let him come i have a      tool to pick his teeth and you ladies and gentlemen walk out into the      garden and you shall witness this giant thunderdells death and      destructionthe castle was situated in the midst of a small island surrounded by a      moat thirty feet deep and twenty feet wide over which lay a drawbridge      so jack employed men to cut through this bridge on both sides nearly to      the middle and then dressing himself in his invisible coat he marched      against the giant with his sword of sharpness although the giant could      not see jack he smelt his approach and cried out in these wordssayst thou so said jack then thou art a monstrous miller indeedthe giant cried out again art thou that villain who killed my kinsmen      then i will tear thee with my teeth suck thy blood and grind thy bones      to powderyoull have to catch me first quoth jack and throwing off his      invisible coat so that the giant might see him and putting on his shoes      of swiftness he ran from the giant who followed like a walking castle      so that the very foundations of the earth seemed to shake at every step      jack led him a long dance in order that the gentlemen and ladies might      see and at last to end the matter ran lightly over the drawbridge the      giant in full speed pursuing him with his club then coming to the      middle of the bridge the giants great weight broke it down and he      tumbled headlong into the water where he rolled and wallowed like a      whale jack standing by the moat laughed at him all the while but      though the giant foamed to hear him scoff and plunged from place to place      in the moat yet he could not get out to be revenged jack at length got a      cartrope and cast it over the two heads of the giant and drew him ashore      by a team of horses and then cut off both his heads with his sword of      sharpness and sent them to king arthurafter some time spent in mirth and pastime jack taking leave of the      knights and ladies set out for new adventures through many woods he      passed and came at length to the foot of a high mountain here late at      night he found a lonesome house and knocked at the door which was      opened by an aged man with a head as white as snow father said jack      can you lodge a benighted traveller that has lost his way yes said      the old man you are right welcome to my poor cottage whereupon jack      entered and down they sat together and the old man began to speak as      follows son i see by your belt you are the great conqueror of giants      and behold my son on the top of this mountain is an enchanted castle      this is kept by a giant named galligantua and he by the help of an old      conjurer betrays many knights and ladies into his castle where by magic      art they are transformed into sundry shapes and forms but above all i      grieve for a dukes daughter whom they fetched from her fathers garden      carrying her through the air in a burning chariot drawn by fiery dragons      when they secured her within the castle and transformed her into a white      hind and though many knights have tried to break the enchantment and      work her deliverance yet no one could accomplish it on account of two      dreadful griffins which are placed at the castle gate and which destroy      every one who comes near but you my son may pass by them undiscovered      where on the gates of the castle you will find engraven in large letters      how the spell may be broken jack gave the old man his hand and promised      that in the morning he would venture his life to free the ladyin the morning jack arose and put on his invisible coat and magic cap and      shoes and prepared himself for the fray now when he had reached the top      of the mountain he soon discovered the two fiery griffins but passed them      without fear because of his invisible coat when he had got beyond them      he found upon the gates of the castle a golden trumpet hung by a silver      chain under which these lines were engravedjack had no sooner read this but he blew the trumpet at which the castle      trembled to its vast foundations and the giant and conjurer were in      horrid confusion biting their thumbs and tearing their hair knowing      their wicked reign was at an end then the giant stooping to take up his      club jack at one blow cut off his head whereupon the conjurer mounting      up into the air was carried away in a whirlwind then the enchantment was      broken and all the lords and ladies who had so long been transformed into      birds and beasts returned to their proper shapes and the castle vanished      away in a cloud of smoke this being done the head of galligantua was      likewise in the usual manner conveyed to the court of king arthur      where the very next day jack followed with the knights and ladies who      had been delivered whereupon as a reward for his good services the king      prevailed upon the duke to bestow his daughter in marriage on honest jack      so married they were and the whole kingdom was filled with joy at the      wedding furthermore the king bestowed on jack a noble castle with a      very beautiful estate thereto belonging where he and his lady lived in      great joy and happiness all the rest of their days",

    "original_content": "childe rowland and his brothers twain were playing at the ball and there      was their sister burd ellen in the midst among them allso at last her eldest brother went to the warlock merlin and told him all      the case and asked him if he knew where burd ellen was the fair burd      ellen said the warlock merlin must have been carried off by the      fairies because she went round the church wider shins the      opposite way to the sun she is now in the dark tower of the king of      elfland it would take the boldest knight in christendom to bring her      backif it is possible to bring her back said her brother ill do it or      perish in the attemptpossible it is said the warlock merlin but woe to the man or mothers      son that attempts it if he is not well taught beforehand what he is to      dothe eldest brother of burd ellen was not to be put off by any fear of      danger from attempting to get her back so he begged the warlock merlin      to tell him what he should do and what he should not do in going to seek      his sister and after he had been taught and had repeated his lesson he      set out for elflandthen the second brother got tired and sick of waiting and he went to the      warlock merlin and asked him the same as his brother so he set out to      find burd ellenand when they had waited and waited a good long time childe rowland the      youngest of burd ellens brothers wished to go and went to his mother      the good queen to ask her to let him go but she would not at first for      he was the last of her children she now had and if he was lost all would      be lost but he begged and he begged till at last the good queen let him      go and gave him his fathers good brand that never struck in vain and as      she girt it round his waist she said the spell that would give it      victoryso childe rowland said goodbye to the good queen his mother and went to      the cave of the warlock merlin once more and but once more he said to      the warlock tell how man or mothers son may rescue burd ellen and her      brothers twainwell my son said the warlock merlin there are but two things simple      they may seem but hard they are to do one thing to do and one thing not      to do and the thing to do is this after you have entered the land of      fairy whoever speaks to you till you meet the burd ellen you must out      with your fathers brand and off with their head and what youve not to      do is this bite no bit and drink no drop however hungry or thirsty you      be drink a drop or bite a bit while in elfland you be and never will      you see middle earth againso childe rowland said the two things over and over again till he knew      them by heart and he thanked the warlock merlin and went on his way and      he went along and along and along and still further along till he came      to the horseherd of the king of elfland feeding his horses these he knew      by their fiery eyes and knew that he was at last in the land of fairy      canst thou tell me said childe rowland to the horseherd where the      king of elflands dark tower is i cannot tell thee said the      horseherd but go on a little further and thou wilt come to the      cowherd and he maybe can tell theethen without a word more childe rowland drew the good brand that never      struck in vain and off went the horseherds head and childe rowland      went on further till he came to the cowherd and asked him the same      question i cant tell thee said he but go on a little farther and      thou wilt come to the henwife and she is sure to know then childe      rowland out with his good brand that never struck in vain and off went      the cowherds head and he went on a little further till he came to an      old woman in a grey cloak and he asked her if she knew where the dark      tower of the king of elfland was go on a little further said the      henwife till you come to a round green hill surrounded with      terracerings from the bottom to the top go round it three times      widershins and each time sayand the third time the door will open and you may go in and childe      rowland was just going on when he remembered what he had to do so he out      with the good brand that never struck in vain and off went the      henwifes headthen he went on and on and on till he came to the round green hill with      the terracerings from top to bottom and he went round it three times      widershins saying each timeand the third time the door did open and he went in and it closed with a      click and childe rowland was left in the darkit was not exactly dark but a kind of twilight or gloaming there were      neither windows nor candles and he could not make out where the twilight      came from if not through the walls and roof these were rough arches made      of a transparent rock incrusted with sheepsilver and rock spar and other      bright stones but though it was rock the air was quite warm as it      always is in elfland so he went through this passage till at last he came      to two wide and high foldingdoors which stood ajar and when he opened      them there he saw a most wonderful and glorious sight a large and      spacious hall so large that it seemed to be as long and as broad as the      green hill itself the roof was supported by fine pillars so large and      lofty that the pillars of a cathedral were as nothing to them they were      all of gold and silver with fretted work and between them and around      them wreaths of flowers composed of what do you think why of diamonds      and emeralds and all manner of precious stones and the very keystones      of the arches had for ornaments clusters of diamonds and rubies and      pearls and other precious stones and all these arches met in the middle      of the roof and just there hung by a gold chain an immense lamp made      out of one big pearl hollowed out and quite transparent and in the middle      of this was a big huge carbuncle which kept spinning round and round      and this was what gave light by its rays to the whole hall which seemed      as if the setting sun was shining on itthe hall was furnished in a manner equally grand and at one end of it was      a glorious couch of velvet silk and gold and there sate burd ellen      combing her golden hair with a silver comb and when she saw childe      rowland she stood up and saidthen they sate down together and childe rowland told her all that he had      done and she told him how their two brothers had reached the dark tower      but had been enchanted by the king of elfland and lay there entombed as      if dead and then after they had talked a little longer childe rowland      began to feel hungry from his long travels and told his sister burd ellen      how hungry he was and asked for some food forgetting all about the      warlock merlins warningburd ellen looked at childe rowland sadly and shook her head but she was      under a spell and could not warn him so she rose up and went out and      soon brought back a golden basin full of bread and milk childe rowland      was just going to raise it to his lips when he looked at his sister and      remembered why he had come all that way so he dashed the bowl to the      ground and said not a sup will i swallow nor a bit will i bite till      burd ellen is set freejust at that moment they heard the noise of some one approaching and a      loud voice was heard sayingand then the foldingdoors of the hall were burst open and the king of      elfland rushed instrike then bogle if thou darest shouted out childe rowland and      rushed to meet him with his good brand that never yet did fail they      fought and they fought and they fought till childe rowland beat the      king of elfland down on to his knees and caused him to yield and beg for      mercy i grant thee mercy said childe rowland release my sister from      thy spells and raise my brothers to life and let us all go free and thou      shalt be spared i agree said the elfin king and rising up he went to      a chest from which he took a phial filled with a bloodred liquor with      this he anointed the ears eyelids nostrils lips and fingertips of      the two brothers and they sprang at once into life and declared that      their souls had been away but had now returned the elfin king then said      some words to burd ellen and she was disenchanted and they all four      passed out of the hall through the long passage and turned their back on      the dark tower never to return again and they reached home and the good      queen their mother and burd ellen never went round a church widershins      again",

    "original_content": "once upon a time there was a man and a wife had too many children and      they could not get meat for them so they took the three youngest and left      them in a wood they travelled and travelled and could see never a house      it began to be dark and they were hungry at last they saw a light and      made for it it turned out to be a house they knocked at the door and a      woman came to it who said what do you want they said please let us      in and give us something to eat the woman said i cant do that as my      man is a giant and he would kill you if he comes home they begged hard      let us stop for a little while said they and we will go away before      he comes so she took them in and set them down before the fire and      gave them milk and bread but just as they had begun to eat a great knock      came to the door and a dreadful voice saidwho have you there wife eh said the wife its three poor lassies      cold and hungry and they will go away ye wont touch em man he said      nothing but ate up a big supper and ordered them to stay all night now      he had three lassies of his own and they were to sleep in the same bed      with the three strangersthe youngest of the three strange lassies was called molly whuppie and      she was very clever she noticed that before they went to bed the giant      put straw ropes round her neck and her sisters and round his own      lassies necks he put gold chains so molly took care and did not fall      asleep but waited till she was sure every one was sleeping sound then      she slipped out of the bed and took the straw ropes off her own and her      sisters necks and took the gold chains off the giants lassies she then      put the straw ropes on the giants lassies and the gold on herself and her      sisters and lay downand in the middle of the night up rose the giant armed with a great club      and felt for the necks with the straw it was dark he took his own      lassies out of bed on to the floor and battered them until they were      dead and then lay down again thinking he had managed fine molly thought      it time she and her sisters were out of that so she wakened them and told      them to be quiet and they slipped out of the house they all got out      safe and they ran and ran and never stopped until morning when they saw      a grand house before them it turned out to be a kings house so molly      went in and told her story to the king he said well molly you are a      clever girl and you have managed well but if you would manage better      and go back and steal the giants sword that hangs on the back of his      bed i would give your eldest sister my eldest son to marry molly said      she would tryso she went back and managed to slip into the giants house and crept in      below the bed the giant came home and ate up a great supper and went to      bed molly waited until he was snoring and she crept out and reached      over the giant and got down the sword but just as she got it out over the      bed it gave a rattle and up jumped the giant and molly ran out at the      door and the sword with her and she ran and he ran till they came to      the bridge of one hair and she got over but he couldnt and he says      woe worth ye molly whuppie never ye come again and she says twice      yet carle quoth she ill come to spain so molly took

would      marry your second sister to my second son and molly said she would try      so she set out for the giants house and slipped in and hid again below      the bed and waited till the giant had eaten his supper and was snoring      sound asleep she slipped out and slipped her hand below the pillow and      got out the purse but just as she was going out the giant wakened and      ran after her and she ran and he ran till they came to the bridge of      one hair and she got over but he couldnt and he said woe worth ye      molly whuppie never you come again once yet carle quoth she ill

herself below      the bed the giant wasnt long ere he came home and after he had eaten a      great big supper he went to his bed and shortly was snoring loud molly      crept out and reached over the bed and got hold of the giants hand and      she pulled and she pulled until she got off the ring but just as she got      it off the giant got up and gripped her by the hand and he says now i

    "original_content": "there was once a widow that lived on a small bit of ground which she      rented from a farmer and she had two sons and byandby it was time for      the wife to send them away to seek their fortune so she told her eldest      son one day to take a can and bring her water from the well that she      might bake a cake for him and however much or however little water he      might bring the cake would be great or small accordingly and that cake      was to be all that she could give him when he went on his travelsthe lad went away with the can to the well and filled it with water and      then came away home again but the can being broken the most part of the      water had run out before he got back so his cake was very small yet      small as it was his mother asked him if he was willing to take the half      of it with her blessing telling him that if he chose rather to take the      whole he would only get it with her curse the young man thinking he      might have to travel a far way and not knowing when or how he might get      other provisions said he would like to have the whole cake come of his      mothers malison what like so she gave him the whole cake and her      malison along with it then he took his brother aside and gave him a      knife to keep till he should come back desiring him to look at it every      morning and as long as it continued to be clear then he might be sure      that the owner of it was well but if it grew dim and rusty then for      certain some ill had befallen himso the young man went to seek his fortune and he went all that day and      all the next day and on the third day in the afternoon he came up to      where a shepherd was sitting with a flock of sheep and he went up to the      shepherd and asked him who the sheep belonged to and he answeredthis shepherd also told him to beware of the beasts he should next meet      for they were of a very different kind from any he had yet seenso the young man went on and byandby he saw a multitude of very      dreadful beasts with two heads and on every head four horns and he was      sore frightened and ran away from them as fast as he could and glad was      he when he came to a castle that stood on a hillock with the door      standing wide open to the wall and he went into the castle for shelter      and there he saw an old wife sitting beside the kitchen fire he asked the      wife if he might stay for the night as he was tired with a long journey      and the wife said he might but it was not a good place for him to be in      as it belonged to the red ettin who was a very terrible beast with three      heads that spared no living man it could get hold of the young man would      have gone away but he was afraid of the beasts on the outside of the      castle so he beseeched the old woman to hide him as best she could and      not tell the ettin he was there he thought if he could put over the      night he might get away in the morning without meeting with the beasts      and so escape but he had not been long in his hidinghole before the      awful ettin came in and no sooner was he in than he was heard cryingthe monster soon found the poor young man and pulled him from his hole      and when he had got him out he told him that if he could answer him three      questions his life should be spared so the first head asked a thing      without an end whats that but the young man knew not then the second      head said the smaller the more dangerous whats that but the young      man knew it not and then the third head asked the dead carrying the      living riddle me that but the young man had to give it up the lad not      being able to answer one of these questions the red ettin took a mallet      and knocked him on the head and turned him into a pillar of stoneon the morning after this happened the younger brother took out the knife      to look at it and he was grieved to find it all brown with rust he told      his mother that the time was now come for him to go away upon his travels      also so she requested him to take the can to the well for water that she      might make a cake for him and he went and as he was bringing home the      water a raven over his head cried to him to look and he would see that      the water was running out and he was a young man of sense and seeing the      water running out he took some clay and patched up the holes so that he      brought home enough water to bake a large cake when his mother put it to      him to take the half cake with her blessing he took it in preference to      having the whole with her malison and yet the half was bigger than what      the other lad had gotso he went away on his journey and after he had travelled a far way he      met with an old woman that asked him if he would give her a bit of his      johnnycake and he said i will gladly do that and so he gave her a      piece of the johnnycake and for that she gave him a magical wand that      she might yet be of service to him if he took care to use it rightly      then the old woman who was a fairy told him a great deal that would      happen to him and what he ought to do in all circumstances and after      that she vanished in an instant out of his sight he went on a great way      farther and then he came up to the old man herding the sheep and when he      asked whose sheep these were the answer waswhen he came to the place where the monstrous beasts were standing he did      not stop nor run away but went boldly through amongst them one came up      roaring with open mouth to devour him when he struck it with his wand      and laid it in an instant dead at his feet he soon came to the ettins      castle where he knocked and was admitted the old woman who sat by the      fire warned him of the terrible ettin and what had been the fate of his      brother but he was not to be daunted the monster soon came in sayinghe quickly espied the young man and bade him come forth on the floor and      then he put the three questions to him but the young man had been told      everything by the good fairy so he was able to answer all the questions      so when the first head asked whats the thing without an end he said      a bowl and when the second head said the smaller the more dangerous      whats that he said at once a bridge and last the third head said      when does the dead carry the living riddle me that then the young man      answered up at once and said when a ship sails on the sea with men      inside her when the ettin found this he knew that his power was gone      the young man then took up an axe and hewed off the monsters three heads      he next asked the old woman to show him where the kings daughter lay and      the old woman took him upstairs and opened a great many doors and out of      every door came a beautiful lady who had been imprisoned there by the      ettin and one of the ladies was the kings daughter she also took him      down into a low room and there stood a stone pillar that he had only to      touch with his wand when his brother started into life and the whole of      the prisoners were overjoyed at their deliverance for which they thanked      the young man next day they all set out for the kings court and a      gallant company they made and the king married his daughter to the young      man that had delivered her and gave a nobles daughter to his brother      and so they all lived happily all the rest of their days",

    "title": "THE HISTORY OF TOM THUMB",
    "original_content": "in the days of the great prince arthur there lived a mighty magician      called merlin the most learned and skilful enchanter the world has ever      seenthis famous magician who could take any form he pleased was travelling      about as a poor beggar and being very tired he stopped at the cottage of      a ploughman to rest himself and asked for some foodthe countryman bade him welcome and his wife who was a very goodhearted      woman soon brought him some milk in a wooden bowl and some coarse brown      bread on a plattermerlin was much pleased with the kindness of the ploughman and his wife      but he could not help noticing that though everything was neat and      comfortable in the cottage they seemed both to be very unhappy he      therefore asked them why they were so melancholy and learned that they      were miserable because they had no childrenthe poor woman said with tears in her eyes i should be the happiest      creature in the world if i had a son although he was no bigger than my      husbands thumb i would be satisfiedmerlin was so much amused with the idea of a boy no bigger than a mans      thumb that he determined to grant the poor womans wish accordingly in      a short time after the ploughmans wife had a son who wonderful to      relate was not a bit bigger than his fathers thumbthe queen of the fairies wishing to see the little fellow came in at the      window while the mother was sitting up in the bed admiring him the queen      kissed the child and giving it the name of tom thumb sent for some of      the fairies who dressed her little godson according to her orderstom never grew any larger than his fathers thumb which was only of      ordinary size but as he got older he became very cunning and full of      tricks when he was old enough to play with the boys and had lost all his      own cherrystones he used to creep into the bags of his playfellows fill      his pockets and getting out without their noticing him would again join      in the gameone day however as he was coming out of a bag of cherrystones where he      had been stealing as usual the boy to whom it belonged chanced to see      him ah ah my little tommy said the boy so i have caught you      stealing my cherrystones at last and you shall be rewarded for your      thievish tricks on saying this he drew the string tight round his neck      and gave the bag such a hearty shake that poor little toms legs thighs      and body were sadly bruised he roared out with pain and begged to be let      out promising never to steal againa short time afterwards his mother was making a batterpudding and tom      being very anxious to see how it was made climbed up to the edge of the      bowl but his foot slipped and he plumped over head and ears into the      batter without his mother noticing him who stirred him into the      puddingbag and put him in the pot to boilthe batter filled toms mouth and prevented him from crying but on      feeling the hot water he kicked and struggled so much in the pot that      his mother thought that the pudding was bewitched and pulling it out of      the pot she threw it outside the door a poor tinker who was passing by      lifted up the pudding and putting it into his budget he then walked      off as tom had now got his mouth cleared of the batter he then began to      cry aloud which so frightened the tinker that he flung down the pudding      and ran away the pudding being broke to pieces by the fall tom crept out      covered all over with the batter and walked home his mother who was      very sorry to see her darling in such a woeful state put him into a      teacup and soon washed off the batter after which she kissed him and      laid him in bedsoon after the adventure of the pudding toms mother went to milk her cow      in the meadow and she took him along with her as the wind was very high      for fear of being blown away she tied him to a thistle with a piece of      fine thread the cow soon observed toms oakleaf hat and liking the      appearance of it took poor tom and the thistle at one mouthful while the      cow was chewing the thistle tom was afraid of her great teeth which      threatened to crush him in pieces and he roared out as loud as he could      mother motherwhere are you tommy my dear tommy said his motherhere mother replied he in the red cows mouthhis mother began to cry and wring her hands but the cow surprised at the      odd noise in her throat opened her mouth and let tom drop out      fortunately his mother caught him in her apron as he was falling to the      ground or he would have been dreadfully hurt she then put tom in her      bosom and ran home with himtoms father made him a whip of a barley straw to drive the cattle with      and having one day gone into the fields he slipped a foot and rolled into      the furrow a raven which was flying over picked him up and flew with      him over the sea and there dropped hima large fish swallowed tom the moment he fell into the sea which was soon      after caught and bought for the table of king arthur when they opened      the fish in order to cook it every one was astonished at finding such a      little boy and tom was quite delighted at being free again they carried      him to the king who made tom his dwarf and he soon grew a great      favourite at court for by his tricks and gambols he not only amused the      king and queen but also all the knights of the round tableit is said that when the king rode out on horseback he often took tom      along with him and if a shower came on he used to creep into his      majestys waistcoatpocket where he slept till the rain was overking arthur one day asked tom about his parents wishing to know if they      were as small as he was and whether they were well off tom told the king      that his father and mother were as tall as anybody about the court but in      rather poor circumstances on hearing this the king carried tom to his      treasury the place where he kept all his money and told him to take as      much money as he could carry home to his parents which made the poor      little fellow caper with joy tom went immediately to procure a purse      which was made of a waterbubble and then returned to the treasury where      he received a silver threepennypiece to put into itour little hero had some difficulty in lifting the burden upon his back      but he at last succeeded in getting it placed to his mind and set forward      on his journey however without meeting with any accident and after      resting himself more than a hundred times by the way in two days and two      nights he reached his fathers house in safetytom had travelled fortyeight hours with a huge silverpiece on his back      and was almost tired to death when his mother ran out to meet him and      carried him into the house but he soon returned to courtas toms clothes had suffered much in the batterpudding and the inside      of the fish his majesty ordered him a new suit of clothes and to be      mounted as a knight on a mouseit was certainly very diverting to see tom in this dress and mounted on      the mouse as he rode out ahunting with the king and nobility who were      all ready to expire with laughter at tom and his fine prancing chargerthe king was so charmed with his address that he ordered a little chair to      be made in order that tom might sit upon his table and also a palace of      gold a span high with a door an inch wide to live in he also gave him      a coach drawn by six small micethe queen was so enraged at the honours conferred on sir thomas that she      resolved to ruin him and told the king that the little knight had been      saucy to herthe king sent for tom in great haste but being fully aware of the danger      of royal anger he crept into an empty snailshell where he lay for a      long time until he was almost starved with hunger but at last he ventured      to peep out and seeing a fine large butterfly on the ground near the      place of his concealment he got close to it and jumping astride on it      was carried up into the air the butterfly flew with him from tree to tree      and from field to field and at last returned to the court where the king      and nobility all strove to catch him but at last poor tom fell from his      seat into a wateringpot in which he was almost drownedwhen the queen saw him she was in a rage and said he should be beheaded      and he was again put into a mouse trap until the time of his executionhowever a cat observing something alive in the trap patted it about till      the wires broke and set thomas at libertythe king received tom again into favour which he did not live to enjoy      for a large spider one day attacked him and although he drew his sword      and fought well yet the spiders poisonous breath at last overcame himking arthur and his whole court were so sorry at the loss of their little      favourite that they went into mourning and raised a fine white marble      monument over his grave with the following epitaph",

    "original_content": "lady mary was young and lady mary was fair she had two brothers and      more lovers than she could count but of them all the bravest and most      gallant was a mr fox whom she met when she was down at her fathers      countryhouse no one knew who mr fox was but he was certainly brave      and surely rich and of all her lovers lady mary cared for him alone at      last it was agreed upon between them that they should be married lady      mary asked mr fox where they should live and he described to her his      castle and where it was but strange to say did not ask her or her      brothers to come and see itso one day near the weddingday when her brothers were out and mr fox      was away for a day or two on business as he said lady mary set out for      mr foxs castle and after many searchings she came at last to it and a      fine strong house it was with high walls and a deep moat and when she      came up to the gateway she saw written on itbut as the gate was open she went through it and found no one there so      she went up to the doorway and over it she found writtenstill she went on till she came into the hall and went up the broad      stairs till she came to a door in the gallery over which was writtenbe bold be bold but not too bold lest that your hearts blood should      run coldbut lady mary was a brave one she was and she opened the door and what      do you think she saw why bodies and skeletons of beautiful young ladies      all stained with blood so lady mary thought it was high time to get out      of that horrid place and she closed the door went through the gallery      and was just going down the stairs and out of the hall when who should      she see through the window but mr fox dragging a beautiful young lady      along from the gateway to the door lady mary rushed downstairs and hid      herself behind a cask just in time as mr fox came in with the poor      young lady who seemed to have fainted just as he got near lady mary mr      fox saw a diamond ring glittering on the finger of the young lady he was      dragging and he tried to pull it off but it was tightly fixed and would      not come off so mr fox cursed and swore and drew his sword raised it      and brought it down upon the hand of the poor lady the sword cut off the      hand which jumped up into the air and fell of all places in the world      into lady marys lap mr fox looked about a bit but did not think of      looking behind the cask so at last he went on dragging the young lady up      the stairs into the bloody chamberas soon as she heard him pass through the gallery lady mary crept out of      the door down through the gateway and ran home as fast as she couldnow it happened that the very next day the marriage contract of lady mary      and mr fox was to be signed and there was a splendid breakfast before      that and when mr fox was seated at table opposite lady mary he looked      at her how pale you are this morning my dear yes said she i had      a bad nights rest last night i had horrible dreams dreams go by      contraries said mr fox but tell us your dream and your sweet voice      will make the time pass till the happy hour comesi dreamed said lady mary that i went yestermorn to your castle and i      found it in the woods with high walls and a deep moat and over the      gateway was writtenbut

    "title": "EARL MAR'S DAUGHTER",
    "original_content": "one fine summers day earl mars daughter went into the castle garden      dancing and tripping along and as she played and sported she would stop      from time to time to listen to the music of the birds after a while as      she sat under the shade of a green oak tree she looked up and spied a      sprightly dove sitting high up on one of its branches she looked up and      said coomydove my dear come down to me and i will give you a golden      cage ill take you home and pet you well as well as any bird of them      all scarcely had she said these words when the dove flew down from the      branch and settled on her shoulder nestling up against her neck while she      smoothed its feathers then she took it home to her own roomthe day was done and the night came on and earl mars daughter was      thinking of going to sleep when turning round she found at her side a      handsome young man she was startled for the door had been locked      for hours but she was a brave girl and said what are you doing here      young man to come and startle me so the door was barred these hours ago      how ever did you come herehush hush the young man whispered i was that cooing dove that you      coaxed from off the treebut who are you then she said quite low and how came you to be      changed into that dear little birdmy name is florentine and my mother is a queen and something more than      a queen for she knows magic and spells and because i would not do as she      wished she turned me into a dove by day but at night her spells lose      their power and i become a man again today i crossed the sea and saw you      for the first time and i was glad to be a bird that i could come near you      unless you love me i shall never be happy morebut if i love you says she will you not fly away and leave me one of      these fine daysnever never said the prince be my wife and ill be yours for ever      by day a bird by night a prince i will always be by your side as a      husband dearso they were married in secret and lived happily in the castle and no one      knew that every night coomydove became prince florentine and every year      a little son came to them as bonny as bonny could be but as each son was      born prince florentine carried the little thing away on his back over the      sea to where the queen his mother lived and left the little one with herseven years passed thus and then a great trouble came to them for the      earl mar wished to marry his daughter to a noble of high degree who came      wooing her her father pressed her sore but she said father dear i do      not wish to marry i can be quite happy with coomydove herethen her father got into a mighty rage and swore a great big oath and      said tomorrow so sure as i live and eat ill twist that birdies      neck and out he stamped from her roomoh oh said coomydove its time that i was away and so he jumped      upon the windowsill and in a moment was flying away and he flew and he      flew till he was over the deep deep sea and yet on he flew till he came      to his mothers castle now the queen his mother was taking her walk      abroad when she saw the pretty dove flying overhead and alighting on the      castle wallshere dancers come and dance your jigs she called and pipers pipe      you well for heres my own florentine come back to me to stay for hes      brought no bonny boy with him this timeno mother said florentine no dancers for me and no minstrels for my      dear wife the mother of my seven boys is to be wed tomorrow and sads      the day for mewhat can i do my son said the queen tell me and it shall be done if      my magic has power to do itwell then mother dear turn the twentyfour dancers and pipers into      twentyfour grey herons and let my seven sons become seven white swans      and let me be a goshawk and their leaderalas alas my son she said that may not be my magic reaches not so      far but perhaps my teacher the spaewife of ostree may know better and      away she hurries to the cave of ostree and after a while comes out as      white as white can be and muttering over some burning herbs she brought      out of the cave suddenly coomydove changed into a goshawk and around      him flew twentyfour grey herons and above them flew seven cygnetswithout a word or a goodbye off they flew over the deep blue sea which      was tossing and moaning they flew and they flew till they swooped down on      earl mars castle just as the wedding party were setting out for the      church first came the menatarms and then the bridegrooms friends and      then earl mars men and then the bridegroom and lastly pale and      beautiful earl mars daughter herself they moved down slowly to stately      music till they came past the trees on which the birds were settling a      word from prince florentine the goshawk and they all rose into the air      herons beneath cygnets above and goshawk circling above all the      weddineers wondered at the sight when swoop the herons were down among      them scattering the menatarms the swanlets took charge of the bride      while the goshawk dashed down and tied the bridegroom to a tree then the      herons gathered themselves together into one feather bed and the cygnets      placed their mother upon them and suddenly they all rose in the air      bearing the bride away with them in safety towards prince florentines      home surely a wedding party was never so disturbed in this world what      could the weddineers do they saw their pretty bride carried away and away      till she and the herons and the swans and the goshawk disappeared and      that very day prince florentine brought earl mars daughter to the castle      of the queen his mother who took the spell off him and they lived happy      ever afterwards",

for the country people at that time thought that folks in      london were all fine gentlemen and ladies and that there was singing and      music there all day long and that the streets were all paved with goldone day a large waggon and eight horses all with bells at their heads      drove through the village while dick was standing by the signpost he      thought that this waggon must be going to the fine town of london so he      took courage and asked the waggoner to let him walk with him by the side      of the waggon as soon as the waggoner heard that poor dick had no father      or mother and saw by his ragged clothes that he could not be worse off      than he was he told him he might go if he would so off they set      togetherso dick got safe to london and was in such a hurry to see the fine      streets paved all over with gold that he did not even stay to thank the      kind waggoner but ran off as fast as his legs would carry him through      many of the streets thinking every moment to come to those that were      paved with gold for dick had seen a guinea three times in his own little      village and remembered what a deal of money it brought in change so he      thought he had nothing to do but to take up some little bits of the      pavement and should then have as much money as he could wish forpoor dick ran till he was tired and had quite forgot his friend the      waggoner but at last finding it grow dark and that every way he turned      he saw nothing but dirt instead of gold he sat down in a dark corner and      cried himself to sleeplittle dick was all night in the streets and next morning being very      hungry he got up and walked about and asked everybody he met to give him      a halfpenny to keep him from starving but nobody stayed to answer him      and only two or three gave him a halfpenny so that the poor boy was soon      quite weak and faint for the want of victualsin this distress he asked charity of several people and one of them said      crossly go to work for an idle rogue that i will says dick i      will to go work for you if you will let me but the man only cursed at      him and went onat last a goodnatured looking gentleman saw how hungry he looked why      dont you go to work my lad said he to dick that i would but i do not      know how to get any answered dick if you are willing come along with      me said the gentleman and took him to a hayfield where dick worked      briskly and lived merrily till the hay was madeafter this he found himself as badly off as before and being almost      starved again he laid himself down at the door of mr fitzwarren a rich      merchant here he was soon seen by the cookmaid who was an illtempered      creature and happened just then to be very busy dressing dinner for her      master and mistress so she called out to poor dick what business have      you there you lazy rogue there is nothing else but beggars if you do      not take yourself away we will see how you will like a sousing of some      dishwater i have some here hot enough to make you jumpjust at that time mr fitzwarren himself came home to dinner and when he      saw a dirty ragged boy lying at the door he said to him why do you lie      there my boy you seem old enough to work i am afraid you are inclined      to be lazyno indeed sir said dick to him that is not the case for i would      work with all my heart but i do not know anybody and i believe i am very      sick for the want of foodpoor fellow get up let me see what ails you dick now tried to rise      but was obliged to lie down again being too weak to stand for he had not      eaten any food for three days and was no longer able to run about and beg      a halfpenny of people in the street so the kind merchant ordered him to      be taken into the house and have a good dinner given him and be kept to      do what work he was able to do for the cooklittle dick would have lived very happy in this good family if it had not      been for the illnatured cook she used to say you are under me so look      sharp clean the spit and the drippingpan make the fires wind up the      jack and do all the scullery work nimbly or  and she would shake      the ladle at him besides she was so fond of basting that when she had      no meat to baste she would baste poor dicks head and shoulders with a      broom or anything else that happened to fall in her way at last her      illusage of him was told to alice mr fitzwarrens daughter who told      the cook she should be turned away if she did not treat him kinderthe behaviour of the cook was now a little better but besides this dick      had another hardship to get over his bed stood in a garret where there      were so many holes in the floor and the walls that every night he was      tormented with rats and mice a gentleman having given dick a penny for      cleaning his shoes he thought he would buy a cat with it the next day he      saw a girl with a cat and asked her will you let me have that cat for a      penny the girl said yes that i will master though she is an      excellent mouserdick hid his cat in the garret and always took care to carry a part of      his dinner to her and in a short time he had no more trouble with the      rats and mice but slept quite sound every nightsoon after this his master had a ship ready to sail and as it was the      custom that all his servants should have some chance for good fortune as      well as himself he called them all into the parlour and asked them what      they would send outthey all had something that they were willing to venture except poor dick      who had neither money nor goods and therefore could send nothing for      this reason he did not come into the parlour with the rest but miss alice      guessed what was the matter and ordered him to be called in she then      said i will lay down some money for him from my own purse but her      father told her this will not do for it must be something of his ownwhen poor dick heard this he said i have nothing but a cat which i      bought for a penny some time since of a little girlfetch your cat then my lad said mr fitzwarren and let her godick went upstairs and brought down poor puss with tears in his eyes and      gave her to the captain for he said i shall now be kept awake all      night by the rats and mice all the company laughed at dicks odd      venture and miss alice who felt pity for him gave him some money to buy      another catthis and many other marks of kindness shown him by miss alice made the      illtempered cook jealous of poor dick and she began to use him more      cruelly than ever and always made game of him for sending his cat to seashe asked him do you think your cat will sell for as much money as would      buy a stick to beat youat last poor dick could not bear this usage any longer and he thought he      would run away from his place so he packed up his few things and started      very early in the morning on allhallows day the first of november he      walked as far as holloway and there sat down on a stone which to this      day is called whittingtons stone and began to think to himself which      road he should takewhile he was thinking what he should do the bells of bow church which at      that time were only six began to ring and their sound seemed to say to      himturn again whittington thrice lord mayor of londonlord mayor of london said he to himself why to be sure i would put      up with almost anything now to be lord mayor of london and ride in a      fine coach when i grow to be a man well i will go back and think      nothing of the cuffing and scolding of the old cook if i am to be lord      mayor of london at lastdick went back and was lucky enough to get into the house and set about      his work before the old cook came downstairswe must now follow miss puss to the coast of africa the ship with the cat      on board was a long time at sea and was at last driven by the winds on a      part of the coast of barbary where the only people were the moors      unknown to the english the people came in great numbers to see the      sailors because they were of different colour to themselves and treated      them civilly and when they became better acquainted were very eager to      buy the fine things that the ship was loaded withwhen the captain saw this he sent patterns of the best things he had to      the king of the country who was so much pleased with them that he sent      for the captain to the palace here they were placed as it is the custom      of the country on rich carpets flowered with gold and silver the king      and queen were seated at the upper end of the room and a number of dishes      were brought in for dinner they had not sat long when a vast number of      rats and mice rushed in and devoured all the meat in an instant the      captain wondered at this and asked if these vermin were not unpleasantoh yes said they very offensive and the king would give half his      treasure to be freed of them for they not only destroy his dinner as you      see but they assault him in his chamber and even in bed and so that he      is obliged to be watched while he is sleeping for fear of themthe captain jumped for joy he remembered poor whittington and his cat      and told the king he had a creature on board the ship that would despatch      all these vermin immediately the king jumped so high at the joy which the      news gave him that his turban dropped off his head bring this creature      to me says he vermin are dreadful in a court and if she will perform      what you say i will load your ship with gold and jewels in exchange for      herthe captain who knew his business took this opportunity to set forth the      merits of miss puss he told his majesty it is not very convenient to      part with her as when she is gone the rats and mice may destroy the      goods in the ship but to oblige your majesty i will fetch herrun run said the queen i am impatient to see the dear creatureaway went the captain to the ship while another dinner was got ready he      put puss under his arm and arrived at the place just in time to see the      table full of rats when the cat saw them she did not wait for bidding      but jumped out of the captains arms and in a few minutes laid almost all      the rats and mice dead at her feet the rest of them in their fright      scampered away to their holesthe king was quite charmed to get rid so easily of such plagues and the      queen desired that the creature who had done them so great a kindness      might be brought to her that she might look at her upon which the      captain called pussy pussy pussy and she came to him he then      presented her to the queen who started back and was afraid to touch a      creature who had made such a havoc among the rats and mice however when      the captain stroked the cat and called pussy pussy the queen also      touched her and cried putty putty for she had not learned english he      then put her down on the queens lap where she purred and played with her      majestys hand and then purred herself to sleepthe king having seen the exploits of mrs puss and being informed that      her kittens would stock the whole country and keep it free from rats      bargained with the captain for the whole ships cargo and then gave him      ten times as much for the cat as all the rest amounted tothe captain then took leave of the royal party and set sail with a fair      wind for england and after a happy voyage arrived safe in londonone morning early mr fitzwarren had just come to his countinghouse and      seated himself at the desk to count over the cash and settle the      business for the day when somebody came tap tap at the door whos      there said mr fitzwarren a friend answered the other i come to      bring you good news of your ship unicorn the merchant bustling      up in such a hurry that he forgot his gout opened the door and who      should he see waiting but the captain and factor with a cabinet of      jewels and a bill of lading when he looked at this the merchant lifted      up his eyes and thanked heaven for sending him such a prosperous voyagethey then told the story of the cat and showed the rich present that the      king and queen had sent for her to poor dick as soon as the merchant      heard this he called out to his servantsmr fitzwarren now showed himself to be a good man for when some of his      servants said so great a treasure was too much for him he answered god      forbid i should deprive him of the value of a single penny it is his own      and he shall have it to a farthing he then sent for dick who at that      time was scouring pots for the cook and was quite dirty he would have      excused himself from coming into the countinghouse saying the room is      swept and my shoes are dirty and full of hobnails but the merchant      ordered him to come inmr fitzwarren ordered a chair to be set for him and so he began to think      they were making game of him at the same time said to them do not play      tricks with a poor simple boy but let me go down again if you please to      my workindeed mr whittington said the merchant we are all quite in earnest      with you and i most heartily rejoice in the news that these gentlemen      have brought you for the captain has sold your cat to the king of      barbary and brought you in return for her more riches than i possess in      the whole world and i wish you may long enjoy themmr fitzwarren then told the men to open the great treasure they had      brought with them and said mr whittington has nothing to do but to put      it in some place of safetypoor dick hardly knew how to behave himself for joy he begged his master      to take what part of it he pleased since he owed it all to his kindness      no no answered mr fitzwarren this is all your own and i have no      doubt but you will use it welldick next asked his mistress and then miss alice to accept a part of his      good fortune but they would not and at the same time told him they felt      great joy at his good success but this poor fellow was too kindhearted      to keep it all to himself so he made a present to the captain the mate      and the rest of mr fitzwarrens servants and even to the illnatured old      cookafter this mr fitzwarren advised him to send for a proper tailor and get      himself dressed like a gentleman and told him he was welcome to live in      his house till he could provide himself with a betterwhen whittingtons face was washed his hair curled his hat cocked and      he was dressed in a nice suit of clothes he was as handsome and genteel as      any young man who visited at mr fitzwarrens so that miss alice who had      once been so kind to him and thought of him with pity now looked upon      him as fit to be her sweetheart and the more so no doubt because      whittington was now always thinking what he could do to oblige her and      making her the prettiest presents that could bemr fitzwarren soon saw their love for each other and proposed to join      them in marriage and to this they both readily agreed a day for the      wedding was soon fixed and they were attended to church by the lord      mayor the court of aldermen the sheriffs and a great number of the      richest merchants in london whom they afterwards treated with a very rich      feasthistory tells us that mr whittington and his lady liven in great      splendour and were very happy they had several children he was sheriff      of london thrice lord mayor and received the honour of knighthood by      henry vhe entertained this king and his queen at dinner after his conquest of      france so grandly that the king said never had prince such a subject       when sir richard heard this he said never had subject such a princethe figure of sir richard whittington with his cat in his arms carved in      stone was to be seen till the year 1780 over the archway of the old      prison of newgate which he built for criminals",

    "original_content": "in bamborough castle once lived a king who had a fair wife and two      children a son named childe wynd and a daughter named margaret childe      wynd went forth to seek his fortune and soon after he had gone the queen      his mother died the king mourned her long and faithfully but one day      while he was hunting he came across a lady of great beauty and became so      much in love with her that he determined to marry her so he sent word      home that he was going to bring a new queen to bamborough castleprincess margaret was not very glad to hear of her mothers place being      taken but she did not repine but did her fathers bidding and at the      appointed day came down to the castle gate with the keys all ready to hand      over to her stepmother soon the procession drew near and the new queen      came towards princess margaret who bowed low and handed her the keys of      the castle she stood there with blushing cheeks and eye on ground and      said o welcome father dear to your halls and bowers and welcome to      you my new mother for all thats here is yours and again she offered      the keys one of the kings knights who had escorted the new queen cried      out in admiration surely this northern princess is the loveliest of her      kind at that the new queen flushed up and cried out at least your      courtesy might have excepted me and then she muttered below her breath      ill soon put an end to her beautythat same night the queen who was a noted witch stole down to a lonely      dungeon wherein she did her magic and with spells three times three and      with passes nine times nine she cast princess margaret under her spell      and this was her spellso lady margaret went to bed a beauteous maiden and rose up a laidly      worm and when her maidens came in to dress her in the morning they found      coiled up on the bed a dreadful dragon which uncoiled itself and came      towards them but they ran away shrieking and the laidly worm crawled and      crept and crept and crawled till it reached the heugh or rock of the      spindlestone round which it coiled itself and lay there basking with its      terrible snout in the airsoon the country round about had reason to know of the laidly worm of      spindleston heugh for hunger drove the monster out from its cave and it      used to devour everything it could come across so at last they went to a      mighty warlock and asked him what they should do then he consulted his      works and his familiar and told them the laidly worm is really the      princess margaret and it is hunger that drives her forth to do such deeds      put aside for her seven kine and each day as the sun goes down carry      every drop of milk they yield to the stone trough at the foot of the      heugh and the laidly worm will trouble the country no longer but if ye      would that she be borrowed to her natural shape and that she who      bespelled her be rightly punished send over the seas for her brother      childe wyndall was done as the warlock advised the laidly worm lived on the milk of      the seven kine and the country was troubled no longer but when childe      wynd heard the news he swore a mighty oath to rescue his sister and      revenge her on her cruel stepmother and threeandthirty of his men took      the oath with him then they set to work and built a long ship and its      keel they made of the rowan tree and when all was ready they out with      their oars and pulled sheer for bamborough keepbut as they got near the keep the stepmother felt by her magic power that      something was being wrought against her so she summoned her familiar imps      and said childe wynd is coming over the seas he must never land raise      storms or bore the hull but nohow must he touch shore then the imps      went forth to meet childe wynds ship but when they got near they found      they had no power over the ship for its keel was made of the rowan tree      so back they came to the queen witch who knew not what to do she ordered      her menatarms to resist childe wynd if he should land near them and by      her spells she caused the laidly worm to wait by the entrance of the      harbouras the ship came near the worm unfolded its coils and dipping into the      sea caught hold of the ship of childe wynd and banged it off the shore      three times childe wynd urged his men on to row bravely and strong but      each time the laidly worm kept it off the shore then childe wynd ordered      the ship to be put about and the witchqueen thought he had given up the      attempt but instead of that he only rounded the next point and landed      safe and sound in budle creek and then with sword drawn and bow bent      rushed up followed by his men to fight the terrible worm that had kept      him from landingbut the moment childe wynd had landed the witchqueens power over the      laidly worm had gone and she went back to her bower all alone not an      imp nor a manatarms to help her for she knew her hour was come so      when childe wynd came rushing up to the laidly worm it made no attempt to      stop him or hurt him but just as he was going to raise his sword to slay      it the voice of his own sister margaret came from its jaws sayingchilde wynd stayed his hand but he did not know what to think if some      witchery were not in it then said the laidly worm againthen childe wynd went up to the laidly worm and kissed it once but no      change came over it then childe wynd kissed it once more but yet no      change came over it for a third time he kissed the loathsome thing and      with a hiss and a roar the laidly worm reared back and before childe wynd      stood his sister margaret he wrapped his cloak about her and then went      up to the castle with her when he reached the keep he went off to the      witch queens bower and when he saw her he touched her with a twig of a      rowan tree no sooner had he touched her than she shrivelled up and      shrivelled up till she became a huge ugly toad with bold staring eyes      and a horrible hiss she croaked and she hissed and then hopped away down      the castle steps and childe wynd took his fathers place as king and      they all lived happy afterwardsbut to this day the loathsome toad is seen at times haunting the      neighbourhood of bamborough keep and the wicked witchqueen is a laidly      toad",

    "original_content": "once upon a time there was a mighty baron in the north countrie who was a      great magician that knew everything that would come to pass so one day      when his little boy was four years old he looked into the book of fate to      see what would happen to him and to his dismay he found that his son      would wed a lowly maid that had just been born in a house under the shadow      of york minster now the baron knew the father of the little girl was      very very poor and he had five children already so he called for his      horse and rode into york and passed by the fathers house and saw him      sitting by the door sad and doleful so he dismounted and went up to him      and said what is the matter my good man and the man said well your      honour the fact is ive five children already and now a sixths come a      little lass and where to get the bread from to fill their mouths thats      more than i can saydont be downhearted my man said the baron if thats your trouble i      can help you ill take away the last little one and you wont have to      bother about herthank you kindly sir said the man and he went in and brought out the      lass and gave her to the baron who mounted his horse and rode away with      her and when he got by the bank of the river ouse he threw the little      thing into the river and rode off to his castlebut the little lass didnt sink her clothes kept her up for a time and      she floated and she floated till she was cast ashore just in front of a      fishermans hut there the fisherman found her and took pity on the poor      little thing and took her into his house and she lived there till she was      fifteen years old and a fine handsome girlone day it happened that the baron went out hunting with some companions      along the banks of the river ouse and stopped at the fishermans hut to      get a drink and the girl came out to give it to them they all noticed      her beauty and one of them said to the baron you can read fates baron      whom will she marry dye thinkoh thats easy to guess said the baron some yokel or other but ill      cast her horoscope come here girl and tell me on what day you were      borni dont know sir said the girl i was picked up just here after      having been brought down by the river about fifteen years agothen the baron knew who she was and when they went away he rode back and      said to the girl hark ye girl i will make your fortune take this      letter to my brother in scarborough and you will be settled for life       and the girl took the letter and said she would go now this was what he      had written in the letterdear brother take the bearer and put her to death immediatelyyours affectionatelyalbertso soon after the girl set out for scarborough and slept for the night at      a little inn now that very night a band of robbers broke into the inn      and searched the girl who had no money and only the letter so they      opened this and read it and thought it a shame the captain of the      robbers took a pen and paper and wrote this letterdear brother take the bearer and marry her to my son immediatelyyours affectionatelyalbertand then he gave it to the girl bidding her begone so she went on to the      barons brother at scarborough a noble knight with whom the barons son      was staying when she gave the letter to his brother he gave orders for      the wedding to be prepared at once and they were married that very daysoon after the baron himself came to his brothers castle and what was      his surprise to find that the very thing he had plotted against had come      to pass but he was not to be put off that way and he took out the girl      for a walk as he said along the cliffs and when he got her all alone      he took her by the arms and was going to throw her over but she begged      hard for her life i have not done anything she said if you will only      spare me i will do whatever you wish i will never see you or your son      again till you desire it then the baron took off his gold ring and threw      it into the sea saying never let me see your face till you can show me      that ring and he let her gothe poor girl wandered on and on till at last she came to a great nobles      castle and she asked to have some work given to her and they made her      the scullion girl of the castle for she had been used to such work in the      fishermans hutnow one day who should she see coming up to the nobles house but the      baron and his brother and his son her husband she didnt know what to      do but thought they would not see her in the castle kitchen so she went      back to her work with a sigh and set to cleaning a huge big fish that was      to be boiled for their dinner and as she was cleaning it she saw      something shine inside it and what do you think she found why there was      the barons ring the very one he had thrown over the cliff at      scarborough she was right glad to see it you may be sure then she      cooked the fish as nicely as she could and served it upwell when the fish came on the table the guests liked it so well that      they asked the noble who cooked it he said he didnt know but called to      his servants ho there send up the cook that cooked that fine fish so      they went down to the kitchen and told the girl she was wanted in the      hall then she washed and tidied herself and put the barons gold ring on      her thumb and went up into the hallwhen the banqueters saw such a young and beautiful cook they were      surprised but the baron was in a tower of a temper and started up as if      he would do her some violence so the girl went up to him with her hand      before her with the ring on it and she put it down before him on the      table then at last the baron saw that no one could fight against fate      and he handed her to a seat and announced to all the company that this was      his sons true wife and he took her and his son home to his castle and      they all lived as happy as could be ever afterwards",

the queens daughter though they loved one another      like real sisters the queen was jealous of the kings daughter being      bonnier than her own and cast about to spoil her beauty so she took      counsel of the henwife who told her to send the lassie to her next      morning fastingso next morning early the queen said to anne go my dear to the      henwife in the glen and ask her for some eggs so anne set out but as      she passed through the kitchen she saw a crust and she took and munched      it as she went alongwhen she came to the henwifes she asked for eggs as she had been told to      do the henwife said to her lift the lid off that pot there and see       the lassie did so but nothing happened go home to your minnie and tell      her to keep her larder door better locked said the henwife so she went      home to the queen and told her what the henwife had said the queen knew      from this that the lassie had had something to eat so watched the next      morning and sent her away fasting but the princess saw some countryfolk      picking peas by the roadside and being very kind she spoke to them and      took a handful of the peas which she ate by the waywhen she came to the henwifes she said lift the lid off the pot and      youll see so anne lifted the lid but nothing happened then the henwife      was rare angry and said to anne tell your minnie the pot wont boil if      the fires away so anne went home and told the queenthe third day the queen goes along with the girl herself to the henwife      now this time when anne lifted the lid off the pot off falls her own      pretty head and on jumps a sheeps headso the queen was now quite satisfied and went back homeher own daughter kate however took a fine linen cloth and wrapped it      round her sisters head and took her by the hand and they both went out to      seek their fortune they went on and they went on and they went on till      they came to a castle kate knocked at the door and asked for a nights      lodging for herself and a sick sister they went in and found it was a      kings castle who had two sons and one of them was sickening away to      death and no one could find out what ailed him and the curious thing was      that whoever watched him at night was never seen any more so the king had      offered a peck of silver to anyone who would stop up with him now katie      was a very brave girl so she offered to sit up with himtill midnight all goes well as twelve o clock rings however the sick      prince rises dresses himself and slips downstairs kate followed but he      didnt seem to notice her the prince went to the stable saddled his      horse called his hound jumped into the saddle and kate leapt lightly up      behind him away rode the prince and kate through the greenwood kate as      they pass plucking nuts from the trees and filling her apron with them      they rode on and on till they came to a green hill the prince here drew      bridle and spoke open open green hill and let the young prince in      with his horse and his hound and kate added and his lady him behindimmediately the green hill opened and they passed in the prince entered a      magnificent hall brightly lighted up and many beautiful fairies      surrounded the prince and led him off to the dance meanwhile kate      without being noticed hid herself behind the door there she sees the      prince dancing and dancing and dancing till he could dance no longer      and fell upon a couch then the fairies would fan him till he could rise      again and go on dancingat last the cock crew and the prince made all haste to get on horseback      kate jumped up behind and home they rode when the morning sun rose they      came in and found kate sitting down by the fire and cracking her nuts      kate said the prince had a good night but she would not sit up another      night unless she was to get a peck of gold the second night passed as the      first had done the prince got up at midnight and rode away to the green      hill and the fairy ball and kate went with him gathering nuts as they      rode through the forest this time she did not watch the prince for she      knew he would dance and dance and dance but she sees a fairy baby      playing with a wand and overhears one of the fairies say three strokes      of that wand would make kates sick sister as bonnie as ever she was so      kate rolled nuts to the fairy baby and rolled nuts till the baby toddled      after the nuts and let fall the wand and kate took it up and put it in      her apron and at cockcrow they rode home as before and the moment kate      got home to her room she rushed and touched anne three times with the      wand and the nasty sheeps head fell off and she was her own pretty self      again the third night kate consented to watch only if she should marry      the sick prince all went on as on the first two nights this time the      fairy baby was playing with a birdie kate heard one of the fairies say      three bites of that birdie would make the sick prince as well as ever he      was kate rolled all the nuts she had to the fairy baby till the birdie      was dropped and kate put it in her apronat cockcrow they set off again but instead of cracking her nuts as she      used to do this time kate plucked the feathers off and cooked the birdie      soon there arose a very savoury smell oh said the sick prince i wish      i had a bite of that birdie so kate gave him a bite of the birdie and      he rose up on his elbow byandby he cried out again oh if i had      another bite of that birdie so kate gave him another bite and he sat up      on his bed then he said again oh if i only had a third bite of that      birdie so kate gave him a third bite and he rose quite well dressed      himself and sat down by the fire and when the folk came in next morning      they found kate and the young prince cracking nuts together meanwhile his      brother had seen annie and had fallen in love with her as everybody did      who saw her sweet pretty face so the sick son married the well sister      and the well son married the sick sister and they all lived happy and      died happy and never drank out of a dry cappy",

    "original_content": "a lad named jack was once so unhappy at home through his fathers      illtreatment that he made up his mind to run away and seek his fortune      in the wide worldhe ran and he ran till he could run no longer and then he ran right up      against a little old woman who was gathering sticks he was too much out      of breath to beg pardon but the woman was goodnatured and she said he      seemed to be a likely lad so she would take him to be her servant and      would pay him well he agreed for he was very hungry and she brought him      to her house in the wood where he served her for a twelvemonths and a      daywhen the year had passed she called him to her and said she had good      wages for him so she presented him with an ass out of the stable and he      had but to pull neddys ears to make him begin at once to ee aw and      when he brayed there dropped from his mouth silver sixpences and half      crowns and golden guineasthe lad was well pleased with the wage he had received and away he rode      till he reached an inn there he ordered the best of everything and when      the innkeeper refused to serve him without being paid beforehand the boy      went off to the stable pulled the asss ears and obtained his pocket full      of money the host had watched all this through a crack in the door and      when night came on he put an ass of his own for the precious neddy of the      poor youth so jack without knowing that any change had been made rode      away next morning to his fathers housenow i must tell you that near his home dwelt a poor widow with an only      daughter the lad and the maiden were fast friends and true loves but      when jack asked his fathers leave to marry the girl never till you have      the money to keep her was the reply i have that father said the      lad and going to the ass he pulled its long ears well he pulled and he      pulled till one of them came off in his hands but neddy though he      heehawed and he heehawed let fall no half crowns or guineas the father      picked up a hayfork and beat his son out of the house i promise you he      ran ah he ran and ran till he came bang against the door and burst it      open and there he was in a joiners shop youre a likely lad said the      joiner serve me for a twelvemonths and a day and i will pay you well       so he agreed and served the carpenter for a year and a day now said      the master i will give you your wage and he presented him with a      table telling him he had but to say table be covered and at once it      would be spread with lots to eat and drinkjack hitched the table on his back and away he went with it till he came      to the inn well host shouted he my dinner today and that of the      bestvery sorry but there is nothing in the house but ham and eggsham and eggs for me exclaimed jack i can do better than that come      my table be coveredat once the table was spread with turkey and sausages roast mutton      potatoes and greens the publican opened his eyes but he said nothing      not hethat night he fetched down from his attic a table very like that of jack      and exchanged the two jack none the wiser next morning hitched the      worthless table on to his back and carried it home now father may i      marry my lass he askednot unless you can keep her replied the father look here exclaimed      jack father i have a table which does all my biddinglet me see it said the old manthe lad set it in the middle of the room and bade it be covered but all      in vain the table remained bare in a rage the father caught the      warmingpan down from the wall and warmed his sons back with it so that      the boy fled howling from the house and ran and ran till he came to a      river and tumbled in a man picked him out and bade him assist him in      making a bridge over the river and how do you think he was doing it why      by casting a tree across so jack climbed up to the top of the tree and      threw his weight on it so that when the man had rooted the tree up jack      and the treehead dropped on the farther bankthank you said the man and now for what you have done i will pay      you so saying he tore a branch from the tree and fettled it up into a      club with his knife there exclaimed he take this stick and when you      say to it up stick and bang him it will knock any one down who angers      youthe lad was overjoyed to get this stick so away he went with it to      the inn and as soon as the publican appeared up stick and bang him       was his cry at the word the cudgel flew from his hand and battered the      old publican on the back rapped his head bruised his arms tickled his      ribs till he fell groaning on the floor still the stick belaboured the      prostrate man nor would jack call it off till he had got back the stolen      ass and table then he galloped home on the ass with the table on his      shoulders and the stick in his hand when he arrived there he found his      father was dead so he brought his ass into the stable and pulled its      ears till he had filled the manger with moneyit was soon known through the town that jack had returned rolling in      wealth and accordingly all the girls in the place set their caps at him      now said jack i shall marry the richest lass in the place so      tomorrow do you all come in front of my house with your money in your      apronsnext morning the street was full of girls with aprons held out and gold      and silver in them but jacks own sweetheart was among them and she had      neither gold nor silver nought but two copper pennies that was all she      hadstand aside lass said jack to her speaking roughly thou hast no      silver nor gold stand off from the rest she obeyed and the tears      ran down her cheeks and filled her apron with diamondsup stick and bang them exclaimed jack whereupon the cudgel leaped up      and running along the line of girls knocked them all on the heads and      left them senseless on the pavement jack took all their money and poured      it into his trueloves lap now lass he exclaimed thou art the      richest and i shall marry thee",

were performed they had not been long in      the court before they set the king against his own beautiful daughter by      false reports the young princess having lost her fathers love grew      weary of the court and one day meeting with her father in the garden      she begged him with tears in her eyes to let her go and seek her      fortune to which the king consented and ordered her motherinlaw to      give her what she pleased she went to the queen who gave her a canvas      bag of brown bread and hard cheese with a bottle of beer though this was      but a pitiful dowry for a kings daughter she took it with thanks and      proceeded on her journey passing through groves woods and valleys till      at length she saw an old man sitting on a stone at the mouth of a cave      who said good morrow fair maiden whither away so fastaged father says she i am going to seek my fortunewhat have you got in your bag and bottlein my bag i have got bread and cheese and in my bottle good small beer      would you like to have someyes said he with all my heartwith that the lady pulled out her provisions and bade him eat and      welcome he did so and gave her many thanks and said there is a thick      thorny hedge before you which you cannot get through but take this wand      in your hand strike it three times and say pray hedge let me come      through and it will open immediately then a little further you will      find a well sit down on the brink of it and there will come up three      golden heads which will speak and whatever they require that do       promising she would she took her leave of him coming to the hedge and      using the old mans wand it divided and let her through then coming to      the well she had no sooner sat down than a golden head came up singingyes said she and taking it in her lap combed it with a silver comb      and then placed it upon a primrose bank then up came a second and a third      head saying the same as the former so she did the same for them and      then pulling out her provisions sat down to eat her dinnerthen said the heads one to another what shall we weird for this damsel      who has used us so kindlythe first said i weird her to be so beautiful that she shall charm the      most powerful prince in the worldthe second said i weird her such a sweet voice as shall far exceed the      nightingalethe third said my gift shall be none of the least as she is a kings      daughter ill weird her so fortunate that she shall become queen to the      greatest prince that reignsshe then let them down into the well again and so went on her journey      she had not travelled long before she saw a king hunting in the park with      his nobles she would have avoided him but the king having caught a      sight of her approached and what with her beauty and sweet voice fell      desperately in love with her and soon induced her to marry himthis king finding that she was the king of colchesters daughter ordered      some chariots to be got ready that he might pay the king his      fatherinlaw a visit the chariot in which the king and queen rode was      adorned with rich gems of gold the king her father was at first      astonished that his daughter had been so fortunate till the young king      let him know of all that had happened great was the joy at court amongst      all with the exception of the queen and her clubfooted daughter who      were ready to burst with envy the rejoicings with feasting and dancing      continued many days then at length they returned home with the dowry her      father gave herthe humpbacked princess perceiving that her sister had been so lucky in      seeking her fortune wanted to do the same so she told her mother and      all preparations were made and she was furnished with rich dresses and      with sugar almonds and sweetmeats in great quantities and a large      bottle of malaga sack with these she went the same road as her sister      and coming near the cave the old man said young woman whither so      fastwhats that to you said shethen said he what have you in your bag and bottleshe answered good things which you shall not be troubled withwont you give me some said heno not a bit nor a drop unless it would choke youthe old man frowned saying evil fortune attend yegoing on she came to the hedge through which she espied a gap and      thought to pass through it but the hedge closed and the thorns ran into      her flesh so that it was with great difficulty that she got through      being now all over blood she searched for water to wash herself and      looking round she saw the well she sat down on the brink of it and one      of the heads came up saying wash me comb me and lay me down softly       as before but she banged it with her bottle saying take that for your      washing so the second and third heads came up and met with no better      treatment than the first whereupon the heads consulted among themselves      what evils to plague her with for such usagethe first said let her be struck with leprosy in her facethe second let her voice be as harsh as a corncrakesthe third said let her have for husband but a poor country cobblerwell she goes on till she came to a town and it being marketday the      people looked at her and seeing such a mangy face and hearing such a      squeaky voice all fled but a poor country cobbler now he not long before      had mended the shoes of an old hermit who having no money gave him a box      of ointment for the cure of the leprosy and a bottle of spirits for a      harsh voice so the cobbler having a mind to do an act of charity was      induced to go up to her and ask her who she wasi am said she the king of colchesters daughterinlawwell said the cobbler if i restore you to your natural complexion      and make a sound cure both in face and voice will you in reward take me      for a husbandyes friend replied she with all my heartwith this the cobbler applied the remedies and they made her well in a      few weeks after which they were married and so set forward for the court      at colchester when the queen found that her daughter had married nothing      but a poor cobbler she hanged herself in wrath the death of the queen so      pleased the king who was glad to get rid of her so soon that he gave the      cobbler a hundred pounds to quit the court with his lady and take to a      remote part of the kingdom where he lived many years mending shoes his      wife spinning the thread for him",
